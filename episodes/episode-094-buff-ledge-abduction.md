## The Incident

Two summer camp counselors, Michael Lapp and Janet Cornell, witnessed cigar-shaped craft with smaller objects at Lake Champlain. Under hypnotic regression years later, "recovered memories" of being taken aboard craft and examined. Additional camp witnesses saw lights that night but no abduction.

## Why This Case Matters (To Believers)

- Two primary witnesses (though separately hypnotized years after incident)
- Other camp witnesses saw unusual lights
- Occurred during wave of Lake Champlain UFO reports
- Hypnotic testimony detailed and consistent

---

## The Skeptical View

Classic false memory case:

- No abduction reported until hypnotic regression years later
- Hypnosis is unreliable for memory recovery
- Witnesses saw unusual lights (possibly explainable) then constructed abduction narrative under hypnosis
- Lake Champlain area has history of UFO reports (cultural contamination)
- Follows pattern of hypnotic regression cases creating rather than recovering memories

---

## My Take

Another case where hypnotic regression transforms "saw strange lights" into "was abducted." The initial sighting of unusual lights may have been genuine anomalous phenomenon, but the abduction narrative was almost certainly created during hypnotic sessions years later. Case demonstrates ongoing problem in UFO research: reliance on hypnotic regression despite its unreliability for factual memory recovery.

## Production Notes

**Word Count:** 800

Case demonstrates continuing pattern: genuine unusual sighting + years of processing + hypnotic regression = detailed false abduction memories. The methodology undermines the claims.
