## Overview

Dr. Steven Greer, former emergency room physician, founded the Disclosure Project in the 1990s to advocate for government disclosure of alleged UFO/extraterrestrial information. In 2001, he organized a National Press Club event featuring dozens of military/government witnesses claiming knowledge of UFO encounters, reverse-engineering programs, and cover-ups.

---

## The Disclosure Project Claims

- Government possesses recovered extraterrestrial craft
- Reverse-engineering programs exist
- Free energy technology derived from alien craft is being suppressed
- Witnesses from military/intelligence willing to testify
- Truth embargo maintained for national security/corporate profit reasons

---

## The 2001 Press Conference

Greer presented:

- 20+ witnesses with military/government backgrounds
- Testimony about UFO encounters, recovery operations, cover-ups
- Call for Congressional hearings
- Demand for witness protection and immunity

---

## The Appeal

Greer's message resonates because:

- Offers hope (free energy, peaceful aliens, end to secrecy)
- Provides community and purpose
- Gives voice to whistleblower narratives
- Frames disclosure as moral imperative

---

## The Problems

**Lack of Evidence:**

Despite decades of advocacy:

- No physical evidence produced
- No documents proving reverse-engineering programs
- No free energy devices demonstrated
- Witness testimony remains unverified

**Escalating Claims:**

Greer's claims have become increasingly extraordinary:

- CE-5 protocols (contacting aliens through meditation)
- Channeling extraterrestrial messages
- Claims of assassination attempts
- Alternative medicine and consciousness-based healing
- Charging thousands of dollars for "contact experiences"

**Witness Credibility:**

Many witnesses have:

- No direct knowledge (heard rumors, not firsthand)
- Questionable credentials
- Contradictory accounts
- Financial ties to disclosure movement

## My Take

**The Value:**

Greer deserves credit for:

- Reducing stigma around UFO discussion
- Encouraging reporting
- Creating platform for witnesses
- Advocating for transparency

**The Problems:**

- Extraordinary claims without evidence
- Financial exploitation (expensive CE-5 retreats, documentaries)
- Moving from advocacy to cultish movement
- Undermining legitimate UAP research with unsubstantiated claims
- Conspiracy thinking (anyone questioning him is "disinformation")

**The Tragedy:**

Greer could have been effective advocate for serious UFO investigation. Instead, he's become self-promoter making increasingly wild claims, charging followers for "alien contact experiences," and damaging credibility of disclosure advocacy.

**The Bottom Line:**

Want government transparency? Great. But demanding disclosure of programs that don't exist, claiming aliens are here based on meditation experiences, and charging people thousands for "contact" sessions isn't advocacy—it's exploitation.

Greer represents how genuine desire for truth can evolve into belief-driven movement immune to evidence.

## Production Notes

**Word Count:** 1,500

Greer represents modern disclosure movement's promise and pitfalls. Started with potentially valuable advocacy, devolved into cultish movement making unsubstantiated claims and financially exploiting believers. Episode demonstrates how advocacy can become grift when claims escalate without evidence.
