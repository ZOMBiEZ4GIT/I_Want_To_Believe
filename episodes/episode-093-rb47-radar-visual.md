## The Incident

USAF RB-47 reconnaissance aircraft detected unknown object on electronic warfare equipment, then confirmed visually and on ground radar. Object paced aircraft across multiple states, appeared/disappeared from different sensor systems in coordinated pattern. Highly trained crew, multiple detection methods (electronic, visual, ground radar), official USAF documentation.

## Why It Matters

- Multiple sensor confirmation (airborne ECM, ground radar, visual)
- Experienced military crew
- Extended duration (over an hour)
- Object behavior suggested intelligence (pacing aircraft, appearing/disappearing systematically)
- One of strongest radar-visual cases in Blue Book files

## My Take

Excellent case for multi-sensor correlation. The combination of ECM signals, ground radar tracking, and visual confirmation by trained observers makes prosaic explanation difficult. Possible explanations: 1) Coincidental misidentification across multiple systems, 2) Classified military technology, 3) Unusual atmospheric phenomenon affecting multiple sensors, 4) Genuine unknown. The case deserves status as one of best-documented military UFO encounters, though still doesn't prove extraterrestrial technology definitively.

## Production Notes

**Word Count:** 600

Strong military case demonstrating multiple sensor correlation—the gold standard for UFO evidence. Yet even this doesn't prove extraordinary explanation.
