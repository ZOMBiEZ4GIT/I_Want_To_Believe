## 🎯 COLD OPEN

**THE MOMENT:**
November 17, 1986. **5:09 PM local time.** Alaskan airspace.

**Japan Airlines Flight 1628:**
- **Aircraft:** Boeing 747 cargo freighter
- **Crew:** 3 (Captain Kenju Terauchi, Copilot Takanori Tamefuji, Flight Engineer Yoshio Tsukuba)
- **Route:** Paris → Anchorage → Tokyo
- **Cargo:** Beaujolais wine (bottles)
- **Altitude:** 35,000 feet
- **Weather:** Clear, dark (early winter evening)

**Captain Terauchi** (47 years old, 29 years flying experience, former fighter pilot, ~10,000 flight hours):

**5:09 PM:** Notices **two small lights** ahead and below. **White/yellow glow.**

**Thinks:** "Traffic" (another aircraft).

**Lights move CLOSER.** Not typical aircraft pattern.

**5:11 PM:** **Lights shift position.** Now **directly in front** of 747. **Pacing aircraft.**

**Terauchi:** "Do you see that?"

**Copilot Tamefuji:** "Yes. What is it?"

**Lights INTENSIFY.** Brighter. Warmer (cabin temperature rises noticeably).

**Terauchi's description:**
"They were flying in formation. One on each side. Then they moved—directly in front. The cockpit became WARM. Like we were facing exhaust or energy."

---

**5:18 PM:** The lights **TRANSFORM.**

**Two small lights become:**
**TWO LARGE OBJECTS.**

**Shape:** Rectangular/square (like "Christmas cake," Terauchi later said).

**Details visible:**
- **Lights arranged in grids** (multiple ports/windows?)
- **Glowing nozzles** (emitting fire/energy)
- **Metallic structure** (edges defined)

**Size:** Estimates vary (Terauchi: "Four times size of 747")

**Distance:** ~500-1,000 feet ahead

**Behavior:** **Hovering in formation** with JAL 1628 (matching speed: ~500 mph at 35,000 feet)

**Terauchi (to Anchorage ATC):** "We have traffic. Unidentified. Request vectors."

**ATC:** "No traffic on radar in your vicinity."

**Terauchi:** "Visual confirmed. Two large objects. Directly ahead."

---

**5:25 PM:** Objects **vanish.**

**Crew relieved.** Resume normal flight.

**5:26 PM:** **Terauchi sees something behind aircraft.**

**Looks over shoulder (through cockpit window):**

**MASSIVE SILHOUETTE.**

**"Like a giant walnut."** Terauchi's exact words.

**Size:** "As big as two aircraft carriers."

**Distance:** Following 747, ~7-8 miles behind (visible as dark mass against darkening sky).

**Terauchi to ATC:** "We have... something very large behind us."

**ATC:** "We're checking radar."

**FAA Ground Radar (Anchorage):** **Confirms unknown target** behind JAL 1628.

**Military Radar (USAF Regional Operations Control Center):** **Also tracks object.**

---

**5:30-5:39 PM:** **Evasive maneuvers.**

**ATC (to Terauchi):** "Descend to 31,000 feet. Turn heading 270."

**Terauchi complies.** Object follows.

**ATC:** "Descend to 25,000 feet. Turn heading 215."

**Object continues following.**

**Terauchi requests:** "Can we have United Airlines flight in area check our six?"

**ATC contacts United 69 (nearby):** "Can you confirm visual on traffic behind JAL?"

**United 69:** "We see JAL. No traffic behind them." (But by this time, object had disappeared from JAL crew's view)

**5:39 PM:** Object **vanishes** from radar and visual.

**Total duration:** **~30 minutes.**

---

**AFTERMATH:**

**FAA Investigation:** Launched immediately. Radar data reviewed. Crew interviewed.

**Media:** Story leaks (December 1986). International headlines.

**Captain Terauchi:** Grounded. Career destroyed. JAL reassigns him to desk job. Eventually retires early.

**FAA Division Chief John Callahan:** Later reveals (1990s): **CIA held secret meeting** with FAA officials. Reviewed JAL 1628 data. **Conclusion: "This event never happened. Do not discuss."**

**Believers:** Extraordinary encounter. Radar confirmation = proof. Government cover-up.

**Skeptics:** Misidentified military aircraft, Jupiter (planet), or st

ratoliner reflection. Pilot imagination. Radar artifact.

**Same flight. Same 30 minutes. Two completely different stories.**

## 📖 OVERVIEW

**JAL Flight 1628 Incident:**
- November 17, 1986, Alaskan airspace
- Boeing 747 cargo flight (crew of 3)
- Two small objects → two large objects → massive "mothership"
- Duration: ~30 minutes
- Visual (all three crew) + radar confirmation (FAA + military)
- FAA investigation → CIA involvement → pilot's career ended

**Believer position:** Multiple witnesses (trained pilots), radar confirmation (independent verification), evasive maneuvers (not hallucination), government cover-up (CIA meeting suppressed), pilot punished for truth

**Skeptic position:** Misidentified Jupiter + military jets refueling, radar = false positive (temperature inversion), pilot's story evolved/exaggerated, no physical evidence, CIA meeting = routine briefing

**Reality:** **Something appeared on radar and was visually seen.** WHAT it was = disputed.

## 👽 BELIEVER'S CASE (25 min)

### THE WITNESSES (CREDIBLE & TRAINED)

**Captain Kenju Terauchi:**
- **Age:** 47
- **Experience:** 29 years flying, ~10,000 hours
- **Background:** Former Japan Air Self-Defense Force fighter pilot (military training)
- **Reputation:** Excellent safety record, no disciplinary issues

**Copilot Takanori Tamefuji:**
- Experienced commercial pilot
- Corroborated Terauchi's sighting (saw objects)

**Flight Engineer Yoshio Tsukuba:**
- Also saw objects
- Less detailed account (focused on instruments), but confirmed presence

**Believer Point:**
"Three trained observers. All saw same thing. Not amateurs."

### THE ENCOUNTER (DETAILED TIMELINE)

**Phase 1: Small Lights (5:09-5:18 PM)**

**Initial Sighting:**
- **Two lights** (white/yellow)
- **Ahead and below** aircraft
- **Approached** 747

**Terauchi's Actions:**
1. **Observed** (thought traffic)
2. **Checked instruments** (no malfunction)
3. **Alerted crew**

**Phase 2: Large Objects (5:18-5:25 PM)**

**Transformation:**
- **Lights became structures**
- **Rectangular/square shape**
- **Grid-like light patterns** (dozens of lights arranged)
- **Glowing nozzles** (fire/energy emission—visible)

**Size Estimates:**
- **Terauchi:** "Four times larger than 747"
- **Position:** 500-1,000 feet ahead (close proximity—DANGER if collision)

**Physical Effects:**
- **Cockpit warmed** (noticeable temperature rise—Terauchi removed jacket)
- **Bright light** (illuminated cloud deck below)

**Believer Claim:**
"These weren't distant stars or planets. They were CLOSE. Structures VISIBLE."

**Phase 3: The "Mothership" (5:26-5:39 PM)**

**Appearance:**
- **Behind aircraft** (Terauchi saw via window)
- **Massive silhouette** ("like giant walnut," "two aircraft carriers")
- **Dark mass** (blocked stars)

**Radar Confirmation:**
- **FAA Anchorage:** Tracked object
- **USAF radar:** Also detected
- **Position:** Matched visual sighting (behind JAL 1628)

**Evasive Maneuvers:**
- **ATC directed turns, altitude changes**
- **Object followed** (maintained position behind 747)
- **Duration:** ~13 minutes

**Believer:**
"Radar doesn't lie. FAA AND military confirmed. This was REAL."

### RADAR CONFIRMATION (INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION)

**FAA Ground Radar (Anchorage):**
- **Detected unknown target** behind JAL 1628
- **Position consistent** with Terauchi's report
- **No transponder signal** (not commercial aircraft)

**USAF Regional Operations Control Center:**
- **Military radar also tracked object**
- **Confirmed to FAA**

**John Callahan (FAA Division Chief, Accidents & Investigations):**
- **1990s testimony:** "The data showed something was there. Radar doesn't pick up hallucinations."

**Believer Point:**
"Pilot could hallucinate. Radar can't. Both saw same thing = proof."

### THE FAA INVESTIGATION

**Immediate Response:**

**November 17-18, 1986:**
- **FAA interviews crew** (separately)
- **Reviews radar tapes** (video + data recordings)
- **Analyzes flight path**

**Findings (Internal):**
- **Crew credible** (no signs of impairment, dishonesty)
- **Radar data confirmed** (unknown target present)
- **No conventional explanation** identified

**Believer:**
"FAA took it SERIOUSLY. That says something."

### THE CIA MEETING (COVER-UP EVIDENCE)

**John Callahan's Revelation (1990s):**

**The Meeting:**
- **Attendees:** FAA officials, CIA, FBI, Reagan White House science team, FAA Administrator
- **Purpose:** Review JAL 1628 data
- **Location:** FAA headquarters, Washington D.C.
- **Date:** ~3 weeks after incident

**Presented:**
- **Radar tapes** (visual display of JAL 1628 + unknown target)
- **Audio tapes** (pilot-ATC communications)
- **Flight data**

**CIA Officer's Statement (per Callahan):**
"Gentlemen, this event never happened. We were never here. Do not discuss this with anyone."

**Callahan:**
"They confiscated materials. Told us to deny meeting occurred."

**Believer Claim:**
"TEXTBOOK cover-up. CIA involvement = they KNOW it's real."

### CAPTAIN TERAUCHI'S PUNISHMENT

**Career Destruction:**

**Immediate:**
- **Grounded by JAL** (indefinitely)
- **Desk job assignment** (no more flying)

**Public Ridicule:**
- **Media coverage:** Some outlets mocked Terauchi
- **JAL embarrassed:** International airline, public UFO claim = bad PR

**Eventual Outcome:**
- **Returned to flight duty** (after months, reduced capacity)
- **Early retirement** (career never fully recovered)

**Believer Interpretation:**
"Punishment for telling truth. Discourages other pilots from reporting."

### WHY BELIEVERS FIND IT COMPELLING

**Argument 1: MULTIPLE LINES OF EVIDENCE**

- **Visual:** Three witnesses
- **Radar:** Two independent systems (FAA + military)
- **Audio:** ATC recordings (pilot-controller conversation)
- **FAA investigation:** Confirmed credibility

**Believer:**
"This isn't just a story. It's DOCUMENTED."

**Argument 2: TRAINED OBSERVERS**

- **Pilots:** Know aircraft, planets, weather phenomena
- **Wouldn't mistake Jupiter** (common skeptic claim)
- **Described structured craft** (not ambiguous lights)

**Argument 3: PHYSICAL EFFECTS**

- **Cockpit warming:** Consistent with energy emission
- **Radar returns:** Physical phenomenon (not psychological)

**Argument 4: GOVERNMENT COVER-UP**

- **CIA meeting:** Suppression of evidence
- **Pilot punished:** Silencing witnesses
- **Pattern:** Consistent with Roswell, Rendlesham, etc.

**Argument 5: NO CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION**

- **FAA couldn't explain**
- **30+ years later, still debated**
- **Believer:** "If it was Jupiter, FAA would've said so."

[BELIEVER RANT: "Three PILOTS. FAA RADAR. Military RADAR. Thirty MINUTES of visual contact. And the CIA shows up, says 'this never happened,' and the pilot's career is DESTROYED. This is PROOF. Radar-confirmed UFO. Government cover-up. And skeptics say 'Jupiter'? Jupiter doesn't follow you for 30 minutes and show up on RADAR!"]

## 🔬 SKEPTIC'S RESPONSE (22 min)

### THE JUPITER + MILITARY JETS THEORY

**Skeptic Explanation (Dr. Philip Klass, others):**

**Phase 1-2 (Small lights → large objects):**
- **Jupiter** (planet, very bright in November 1986 Alaskan sky)
- **Position:** Low on horizon (where Terauchi saw objects)
- **Brightness:** Increased as eyes adjusted to darkness
- **Movement illusion:** Autokinetic effect (stationary light appears to move when stared at in dark)

**Phase 3 (Mothership):**
- **USAF KC-135 tanker + fighter jets** (mid-air refueling exercise)
- **Common in Alaska** (military base nearby)
- **Large silhouette:** Tanker aircraft (large plane)
- **Radar contact:** Legitimate military aircraft (FAA/USAF radars picked up exercise)

**Skeptic Conclusion:**
"Terauchi saw Jupiter, thought it was UFO. Then saw military exercise, thought THAT was mothership. Misidentification."

### DEBUNKING THE RADAR "CONFIRMATION"

**Radar False Positives:**

**Dr. James Oberg (Aerospace Engineer, Skeptic):**
- **Temperature inversions:** Atmospheric conditions cause radar reflections (false targets)
- **Alaska in November:** Prone to inversions
- **"Target" behind JAL:** Likely atmospheric artifact, not solid object

**No United Airlines Confirmation:**
- **United 69 was nearby:** Looked for JAL's "traffic"
- **Saw nothing:** If massive object present, United would've seen it
- **Skeptic:** Proves object wasn't physical (or didn't exist)

**Military Radar Contact:**
- **Skeptic theory:** Radar detected ACTUAL military jets (refueling exercise), NOT UFO
- **Coincidence:** Military jets in area at same time as JAL sighting

### TERAUCHI'S CREDIBILITY QUESTIONED

**Skeptic Challenges:**

**1. Story Evolution:**
- **Initial report:** Less dramatic (lights, object)
- **Media interviews:** More dramatic ("size of aircraft carriers," "walnut shape")
- **Skeptic:** Story grew with retelling (embellishment)

**2. UFO Believer:**
- **Terauchi admitted:** Had seen UFOs before (prior sightings)
- **Skeptic:** Predisposed to interpret ambiguous stimuli as UFOs (confirmation bias)

**3. Cultural Context:**
- **Japan 1980s:** UFO interest high (popular culture)
- **Terauchi:** May have been influenced by media

**Philip Klass:**
"Terauchi WANTED to see UFO. So when he saw Jupiter, his brain filled in 'alien craft.'"

### THE COPILOT & FLIGHT ENGINEER (LESS CERTAIN)

**Skeptic Point:**

**Copilot Tamefuji:**
- **Saw lights:** But less detailed account than Terauchi
- **Didn't see mothership clearly**

**Flight Engineer Tsukuba:**
- **Focused on instruments:** Saw "something," not detailed structure
- **Later:** Less certain than Terauchi

**Skeptic Interpretation:**
"Terauchi's certainty influenced crew. Classic group dynamics—leader's interpretation becomes shared narrative."

### THE CIA MEETING = ROUTINE BRIEFING

**Skeptic Alternative:**

**John Callahan's Account:**
- **Believer interpretation:** Cover-up
- **Skeptic:** Callahan is UFO believer (bias), exaggerated meeting

**Alternative Explanation:**
- **Meeting occurred:** Routine (FAA briefs agencies on unusual incidents)
- **"This never happened":** Misunderstood instruction (meant "don't leak to media," not "deny reality")
- **CIA presence:** Standard (national security assessment—Cold War, checking for Soviet activity)

**Skeptic:**
"Callahan is selling a narrative. CIA involvement = routine, not sinister."

### TERAUCHI'S GROUNDING = STANDARD PROCEDURE

**Skeptic Explanation:**

**Why JAL Grounded Terauchi:**
1. **Public UFO claim:** Embarrassed airline
2. **Psychological eval:** Standard after pilot reports unusual experience (safety protocol)
3. **Media circus:** JAL wanted to de-escalate (grounding = removing pilot from spotlight)

**Not Punishment:**
- **Terauchi returned to flight duty** (eventually)
- **Retired normally** (not fired)

**Skeptic:**
"Grounding = PR management, not conspiracy."

### WHAT WE CAN PROVE

**Facts:**
- JAL 1628 crew reported seeing objects (November 17, 1986) ✓
- FAA/USAF radar detected something ✓
- FAA investigated ✓
- CIA/FAA meeting occurred (per Callahan) ✓
- Terauchi grounded temporarily ✓

**Cannot Prove:**
- Objects were extraterrestrial craft ✗
- Radar detected alien ship (vs. atmospheric/military) ✗
- CIA covered up evidence ✗

[SKEPTICAL RANT: "Jupiter was BRIGHT that night. It was LOW on the horizon—exactly where Terauchi saw 'objects.' And the mothership? Military tanker refueling jets. Alaska is FULL of military exercises! Radar picked up those jets, NOT an alien ship. Terauchi MIS-IDENTIFIED. He's a UFO believer—admitted it! Of COURSE he saw UFOs. Confirmation bias!"]

## 💭 MY TAKE (8 min)

### WHAT I WANT TO BELIEVE
- That a massive alien mothership followed a 747 for 30 minutes
- That radar proved its existence beyond doubt
- That the CIA covered it up to prevent panic
- That Captain Terauchi was punished for exposing the truth

### WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK
- **50% misidentified Jupiter + military aircraft, 30% atmospheric/radar phenomenon, 20% unknown**
- Leaning misidentification because:
  - **Jupiter WAS bright/visible** (confirmed by astronomy data)
  - **Military exercises common in Alaska** (tanker = "mothership" silhouette plausible)
  - **United 69 saw nothing** (if object massive, they'd have seen it)
  - **Terauchi's story evolved** (grew more dramatic over time)
- But not 100% certain because:
  - **Radar confirmation hard to dismiss** (two systems)
  - **Three witnesses** (not just Terauchi)
  - **FAA took it seriously** (not just dismissed)
  - **30 minutes** (long duration—harder to sustain misidentification)

**Position:** Probably misidentified Jupiter + military jets, but admits radar data complicates skeptical explanation

### THE BIGGER PICTURE

**Why JAL 1628 Matters:**

1. **Radar + Visual = Gold Standard:**
   - **Believers:** "This is THE case—radar proves it!"
   - **Skeptics:** "Radar can be fooled—false positives happen"
   - **Reality:** Radar confirmation ELEVATES case, doesn't PROVE aliens

2. **The Pilot's Dilemma:**
   - **Terauchi reported honestly** (what he believed he saw)
   - **Career destroyed** (temporarily, but damaged)
   - **Lesson:** Pilots STILL reluctant to report UFOs (fear of ridicule/consequences)
   - **Result:** Data suppressed (how many pilots see things, stay silent?)

3. **The CIA Meeting Mystery:**
   - **Callahan's story:** IF true, troubling (government suppression)
   - **But:** Single source (Callahan), no documents leaked
   - **Skeptics:** Exaggerated/misremembered
   - **Believers:** Textbook cover-up
   - **Truth:** Probably somewhere between (meeting happened, significance disputed)

4. **Jupiter: The UFO Explanation Workhorse:**
   - **Skeptics overuse Jupiter** (like skeptics overuse Venus)
   - **But:** Jupiter IS bright, DOES appear to move (autokinetic effect real)
   - **Problem:** Pilots trained to recognize planets (would Terauchi really mistake Jupiter?)
   - **Counter:** Even experts can misidentify under certain conditions (fatigue, darkness, expectation)

5. **The "No Explanation" Problem:**
   - **FAA didn't conclude "Jupiter"** (officially unexplained)
   - **Believers:** "See? They couldn't explain it!"
   - **Skeptics:** "Unexplained ≠ aliens. Just means insufficient data."
   - **Reality:** Some cases WILL remain ambiguous (data incomplete, witnesses fallible)

**What I Learned:**
JAL 1628 is frustrating because it ALMOST has everything believers want: credible witnesses, radar, official investigation. But it's ALSO frustratingly ambiguous: Jupiter was there, military jets were there, United saw nothing, Terauchi's story evolved. It's the PERFECT case study in how UFO evidence is never quite enough—for EITHER side. And that's either because aliens are elusive... or because they're not there.

**Closing Thought:**
If I were Captain Terauchi, I'd believe I saw a UFO too. The experience was clearly profound for him. But subjective certainty ≠ objective truth. I think he saw SOMETHING—most likely Jupiter morphing into military jets in his perception. But I can't prove it. And that's the problem. JAL 1628 will be debated forever because the data is GOOD ENOUGH to keep believers believing, and AMBIGUOUS ENOUGH to keep skeptics skeptical. And maybe that's all UFO evidence ever is.

**Captain Terauchi's Later Life:**
- **Continued flying:** Eventually (reduced capacity)
- **Retired:** Early 2000s
- **Interviews:** Participated in UFO documentaries (maintained sighting was real)
- **Died:** ~2010s (exact date unclear, private person)

**John Callahan's Credibility:**
- **Legitimate FAA career:** Confirmed (Division Chief)
- **UFO conferences:** Frequent speaker (pro-UFO circuit)
- **Skeptic criticism:** Financial interest (paid appearances)
- **Believer defense:** "Risked reputation to tell truth"

**The Jupiter Position:**
- **November 17, 1986:** Jupiter visible, low on horizon (southeastern sky from Alaska)
- **Brightness:** Magnitude -2.0 (very bright, second only to Venus among planets)
- **Skeptic:** "Perfect conditions for misidentification"
- **Believer:** "Trained pilot wouldn't mistake planet"

**United Airlines 69:**
- **Asked by ATC:** Check for traffic behind JAL
- **Response:** "Negative, nothing visible"
- **Significance:** If mothership "size of two aircraft carriers," United should've seen it
- **Believer counter:** "Object cloaked/departed before United looked"

**The Autokinetic Effect:**
- **Psychology:** Stationary light appears to move when stared at in dark (eye movement illusion)
- **Explains:** "Lights approaching" perception (when actually stationary)
- **Common:** Pilots, sailors report (mistaking stars/planets for approaching craft)

**USAF Presence in Alaska:**
- **Elmendorf AFB:** Major base (fighter jets, tankers)
- **Refueling exercises:** Routine (KC-135 tankers + fighters)
- **Skeptic:** "Mothership = tanker silhouette"
- **Believer:** "Terauchi knows what tanker looks like"

**Radar Temperature Inversion:**
- **Atmospheric ducting:** Radar waves bend, create false targets
- **Common in Alaska:** Temperature gradients frequent
- **Skeptic:** "Explains radar 'target'"
- **Believer:** "Two separate radars detected—unlikely both fooled"

**Media Coverage:**
- **1986:** International headlines
- **Japan:** Major story (JAL = national airline)
- **U.S.:** Covered, but less prominent
- **Legacy:** One of most-cited pilot UFO cases

**FAA's Official Position:**
- **No conclusion:** Case closed as "unexplained"
- **Not confirmed as UFO:** Also not debunked officially
- **Ambiguous:** Neither side can claim FAA endorsement
