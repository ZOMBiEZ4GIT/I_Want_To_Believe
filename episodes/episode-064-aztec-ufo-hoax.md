> "Before you can be a skeptic, you have to believe in something." — Dana Scully, Season 2

*Unfortunately, some people believe anything.*

## 🎯 COLD OPEN

**Los Angeles, 1949. A journalist is about to make a terrible mistake.**

Frank Scully, entertainment columnist for *Variety*, attends a lecture by Silas Newton, a wealthy oil magnate with an incredible story:

The U.S. government has recovered **not one, but three** crashed flying saucers. The crashes occurred in New Mexico and Arizona between 1947-1948. The saucers were intact. Inside each craft: **small humanoid bodies**, perfectly preserved.

Newton claims he has inside sources—scientists who examined the craft. He has proof: mysterious devices recovered from the wreckage.

One device, he says, can detect oil deposits from miles away using alien technology. It's worth millions.

Scully is fascinated. He writes it all up in his 1950 book **"Behind the Flying Saucers"**—the first book claiming the government recovered alien craft.

The book becomes a bestseller. Thousands believe. The "Aztec crash" becomes UFO lore.

**There's just one problem: it's all a lie.**

Newton and his partner, Leo GeBauer (using the alias "Dr. Gee"), are con men. They invented the UFO crash story to sell worthless "alien technology" devices to gullible investors.

The "scientists" don't exist. The "crashed saucers" never happened. The "alien devices" are Radio Shack junk assembled in a garage.

In 1952, investigative journalists J.P. Cahn and Charles Laughead expose the entire hoax. Newton and GeBauer are arrested for fraud. Scully's reputation is destroyed.

But the damage is done. The Aztec crash story lives on in UFO culture. Books, documentaries, and "researchers" still claim it's real.

Welcome to the Aztec UFO Crash—the lie that became legend, and the con men who fooled the world.

## 📖 OVERVIEW

The Aztec UFO Crash is a hoax perpetrated by con men Silas Newton and Leo GeBauer in 1949-1950. They claimed that a flying saucer crashed near Aztec, New Mexico in 1948, was recovered by the U.S. government, and contained alien bodies. They used this story to sell fraudulent "alien technology" oil-detection devices to investors. The hoax was exposed in 1952, and the perpetrators were convicted of fraud. Despite being thoroughly debunked, the Aztec crash remains a fixture in UFO lore.

**THE BELIEVER'S CLAIM:** While Newton and GeBauer were frauds, some researchers argue the core Aztec crash story might have been based on real events. They claim Newton learned of an actual crash and embellished it for profit, but that doesn't mean the crash itself didn't happen. Recent "researchers" have attempted to resurrect the case with new "evidence."

**THE SKEPTICAL RESPONSE:** The Aztec crash is a complete fabrication from start to finish. No crash occurred. No evidence exists. No credible witnesses exist. It was a con job to commit fraud, thoroughly exposed and legally prosecuted. Anyone still claiming the Aztec crash is real is either misinformed, delusional, or selling books.

**THE REALITY:** This is a completely debunked hoax. The case is historically important as a cautionary tale about UFO fraud and gullibility, but it has zero credibility as evidence of extraterrestrial visitation.

## 👽 BELIEVER'S CASE (25 MIN)

### The Original Claims

Let me present the story as Newton and GeBauer told it (and as believers still repeat):

**March 25, 1948:** A large flying saucer (100 feet in diameter) crashes on Hart Canyon mesa near Aztec, New Mexico.

**The craft:**
- Disc-shaped, metallic
- Perfectly intact (no damage despite "crash")
- Landed gear-first (suggesting controlled landing, not crash)
- Porthole windows around circumference
- Entry door discovered after scientists figured out how to open it

**The occupants:**
- 16 small humanoid bodies found inside
- Height: 36-42 inches (3-3.5 feet)
- Human-like but with larger heads
- Wearing one-piece flight suits
- Bodies perfectly preserved (no decay)

**The recovery:**
- U.S. military immediately secured the site
- Scientists brought in to study craft
- Bodies removed and stored at secret location
- Craft disassembled and transported
- Entire operation classified

**The technology:**
- Propulsion system based on magnetic principles
- Instruments and devices with unknown purposes
- Some devices allegedly reverse-engineered

Newton claimed his source was a scientist he called "Dr. Gee" (Leo GeBauer in disguise) who worked on the recovery team.

### Frank Scully's Book

Frank Scully's 1950 book "Behind the Flying Saucers" legitimized the story.

Scully was a mainstream journalist (not a UFO crank), which gave the book credibility. He presented the Aztec crash alongside alleged crashes in other locations, claiming the government had recovered multiple craft.

The book was a bestseller, going through multiple printings. It shaped UFO culture's expectations:
- Multiple crashes (not just Roswell)
- Recovered bodies (the "Greys" template)
- Government cover-up
- Reverse-engineering of alien technology

Even after the hoax was exposed, the book's influence persisted. Many UFO researchers absorbed its narratives without knowing the source was fraudulent.

### The "Devices"

Newton and GeBauer showed investors physical "proof": devices allegedly recovered from the saucer.

**The mystery instruments:**
- Metallic boxes with dials and components
- Claimed to detect oil, water, or minerals from great distances
- Supposedly functioned on principles beyond human science
- Investors were shown demonstrations (rigged, of course)

The con: they convinced investors to fund development of these "alien" technologies, pocketing millions.

Believers argue: maybe the devices were fraudulent, but Newton learned about them from someone who really did have alien tech.

### Modern Revival Attempts

Despite thorough debunking, some modern researchers have attempted to resurrect the Aztec crash:

**Scott Ramsey and Suzanne Ramsey** published "The Aztec Incident" (2015), claiming:
- The crash really happened
- They found "new witnesses"
- Military documents support the event
- Newton and GeBauer were telling partial truth

**Their evidence:**
- Secondhand testimony from people who heard about it
- Alleged military documents (authenticity disputed)
- "Witnesses" whose accounts can't be verified

Believers claim the CIA framed Newton and GeBauer to discredit a real event. The fraud conviction, they argue, was a cover-up tactic.

### The "Why Would They Lie?" Argument

Some believers argue: why would Newton (a wealthy oil man) risk his reputation on a hoax?

The claim: Newton was already rich—he didn't need to scam investors. Therefore, he must have believed the story was true, even if he couldn't prove it.

Maybe someone fed Newton disinformation. Maybe he believed "Dr. Gee" had real inside knowledge. The subsequent fraud conviction could have been orchestrated to silence him.

### Pattern with Roswell

Believers point out that Aztec (1948) occurred only one year after Roswell (1947).

If Roswell was real, why not Aztec? The government was allegedly recovering multiple craft in the late 1940s. Aztec fits the pattern.

The fact that Aztec was "exposed as hoax" could be intentional: discredit one crash to protect the cover-up of the others.

### Alleged Witnesses

Modern researchers claim to have found witnesses or secondhand accounts:
- Military personnel stationed in the area
- Scientists who heard about the recovery
- Local residents who saw unusual activity

None of these witnesses are firsthand. They all heard about it from someone else. But believers argue: where there's smoke, there's fire.

### The Magdalena Connection

Some researchers link Aztec to another alleged 1947 crash near Magdalena, New Mexico.

The claim: multiple crashes occurred in New Mexico 1947-1948. Aztec might be a confused or conflated account of a real event.

Even if Newton's specific story was fraudulent, something might have happened that inspired it.

**[BELIEVER RANT:]** "Okay, Newton and GeBauer were con men! But maybe they heard about a REAL crash and exploited it for profit! Maybe the CIA framed them to discredit the story and protect the cover-up! Scott Ramsey's research found new witnesses and documents suggesting something DID happen near Aztec in 1948! And it's suspicious that Aztec occurred right after Roswell—multiple crashes in New Mexico within a year! The pattern makes sense! The government was recovering craft and needed to suppress information! Discrediting Aztec as a hoax was the perfect cover! The core story might still be true even if the messengers were frauds! You can't just dismiss it because Newton was a crook—even crooks sometimes tell the truth!"

## 🔬 SKEPTIC'S RESPONSE (22 MIN)

### It's a Proven, Prosecuted Hoax

Let's start with the facts:

**September 1952:** J.P. Cahn and Charles Laughead publish "The Flying Saucers and the Mysterious Little Men" in *True Magazine*, exposing Newton and GeBauer's fraud.

**Their investigation revealed:**
- "Dr. Gee" was Leo GeBauer, a con man with criminal record
- The "scientists" who examined the craft didn't exist
- The "alien devices" were assembled from radio parts bought at local stores
- Newton and GeBauer used the UFO story to scam investors
- They collected over $200,000 (1950s dollars) from victims

**1953:** Newton and GeBauer were tried and convicted of fraud.

**The court findings:**
- No UFO crash occurred
- No alien bodies existed
- No recovered technology existed
- The entire story was fabricated to commit securities fraud

**This isn't "debunked by skeptics." This is "convicted in court."**

### Newton and GeBauer Were Career Con Men

Silas Newton:
- Oil wildcatter with history of dubious business dealings
- Multiple fraud allegations throughout career
- Charming, persuasive personality (classic con man traits)
- No credibility outside UFO circles

Leo GeBauer (a.k.a. "Dr. Gee"):
- No legitimate scientific credentials
- Criminal record for fraud
- Created "Dr. Gee" persona to sound credible
- Couldn't provide any verifiable information

These men were professional liars. They lied for money. They got caught, prosecuted, and convicted.

**Why would anyone believe anything they said?**

### The "Devices" Were Junk

Investigators examined the "alien technology" devices:

**What they found:**
- Radio parts from hardware stores
- Cheap electronic components
- Assemblies worth about $1.50
- Sold to investors for thousands of dollars

**The "demonstrations":**
- Rigged with confederates providing fake readings
- Classic dowsing rod scam dressed up with electronics
- Easily replicated with no alien technology required

There was no alien tech. There were no mysterious properties. It was a box full of junk.

### Frank Scully Was Duped

Scully wasn't a knowing conspirator—he was a mark.

As a mainstream journalist, his credulity gave the hoax credibility. But he did zero fact-checking:
- Never verified Newton's sources
- Never investigated "Dr. Gee's" credentials
- Never asked for proof
- Accepted the story at face value because it was sensational

After the exposure, Scully's reputation was destroyed. He claimed he'd been misled (which was true), but the damage was done.

**The lesson: even journalists can be fooled by charismatic con men.**

### No Evidence Exists

After 75+ years, no evidence of the Aztec crash has emerged:

**No crash site:** Despite alleged location, no physical traces found

**No wreckage:** Not a single fragment recovered

**No documents:** No military paperwork, reports, or memos

**No credible witnesses:** Not one firsthand witness who saw the craft or bodies

**No photos:** In an era with cameras, not one image exists

**No leaks:** No deathbed confessions from real scientists or military personnel

Compare this to Roswell, which has documents, witnesses, and physical debris (however mundane). Aztec has nothing.

### The "New Research" Is Garbage

Scott and Suzanne Ramsey's book "The Aztec Incident" is thoroughly discredited:

**Their "witnesses":**
- All secondhand or third-hand accounts ("my uncle told me...")
- No firsthand observers
- Testimonies emerged 50-60 years after alleged event (massive memory contamination)
- Many witnesses have financial interest (book sales, speaking fees)

**Their "documents":**
- Authenticity disputed by archivists
- Misinterpretations of routine military paperwork
- No smoking gun evidence

**Their methodology:**
- Cherry-picking supportive statements
- Ignoring contrary evidence
- Motivated reasoning (starting with conclusion, finding support)

The Ramseys are UFO believers selling books. They have every incentive to keep Aztec alive.

### The CIA Didn't Frame Anyone

The conspiracy theory that Newton and GeBauer were framed is absurd.

They committed fraud. Investors lost money. Victims testified. The fraud was documented and proven in court.

The CIA didn't need to frame them—they framed themselves by committing actual fraud.

The simpler explanation: they were con men who got caught.

### Why Newton "Risked His Reputation"

Believers ask: why would wealthy Newton risk his reputation?

**Answer: because con men are greedy.**

Newton wasn't satisfied with his wealth. He wanted more. The UFO story was a vehicle to scam investors in his bogus oil-detecting devices.

This is textbook con behavior: use credibility in one area (oil business) to build trust, then exploit that trust for fraud.

### The Roswell Connection Is Backwards

Aztec didn't happen and get covered up.

Newton and GeBauer *heard about Roswell* (which was in the news in 1947) and realized UFO stories were popular. They invented Aztec to capitalize on that interest.

Aztec is parasitic on Roswell, not corroborating.

### Magdalena and Other "Crashes" Are Also Bogus

Linking Aztec to other alleged crashes doesn't validate it—it just spreads the fraud.

Many alleged 1947-1948 New Mexico crashes are:
- Misidentified military tests (White Sands, Los Alamos nearby)
- Hoaxes piggybacking on Roswell fame
- Conflated accounts creating false events

Piling weak claims together doesn't make them strong.

### The Cautionary Tale

Aztec's real value is as a warning:

**Lessons:**
- Charismatic figures can lie convincingly
- Mainstream journalists can be fooled
- Sensational claims require extraordinary evidence
- Financial motives corrupt testimony
- UFO community must maintain skepticism and fact-check

Aztec shows what happens when those lessons are ignored.

**[SKEPTICAL RANT:]** "Aztec is a PROVEN HOAX! Newton and GeBauer were convicted CRIMINALS who invented the story to scam investors! They sold fake 'alien' devices made from radio parts! There's NO evidence—no wreckage, no bodies, no documents, no credible witnesses! The 'new research' by the Ramseys is garbage—secondhand testimony and disputed documents from people with books to sell! Frank Scully was DUPED and admitted it! The courts PROVED it was fraud! And people STILL claim it's real! This isn't skepticism versus belief—this is legal verdict versus delusion! The CIA didn't frame anyone—Newton and GeBauer framed themselves by committing actual fraud! Aztec is a cautionary tale about how UFO believers will cling to debunked stories rather than admit they've been conned! It's embarrassing!"

## 💭 MY TAKE (8 MIN)

### What I Want to Believe

I can't want to believe in Aztec. It's too tainted.

Even as someone who wants UFO stories to be true, I can't rehabilitate a proven fraud. Newton and GeBauer were con men. They lied for money. They got caught. End of story.

There's no romance here, no mystery—just greed and gullibility.

### What I Think I Believe

Aztec is 100% hoax. No ambiguity. No gray area.

The court conviction, the exposed fraud, the fake devices—it's all documented. Anyone still claiming Aztec is real is either:

1. **Ignorant** (doesn't know the history)
2. **Delusional** (can't accept being wrong)
3. **Profiting** (selling books/documentaries)

The "new research" is motivated reasoning by believers who can't let go.

### The Damage to UFO Research

Aztec damaged serious UFO research in multiple ways:

**1. Credibility loss:** The exposure made mainstream media dismiss all UFO claims as hoaxes

**2. Template for fraud:** Showed future hoaxers how to craft convincing stories

**3. Contaminated legitimate cases:** Aztec's details (small bodies, intact craft) became expectations that influenced later testimony

**4. Distraction:** Researchers wasting time on Aztec instead of investigating genuine unknowns

Aztec is a cautionary tale that the UFO community should embrace, not deny.

### Why People Still Believe

Despite total debunking, Aztec persists because:

**Emotional investment:** Admitting you believed a hoax feels like personal failure

**Sunk cost:** After years of believing, changing your mind means admitting wasted time

**Community identity:** UFO believers bond over shared stories; rejecting Aztec feels like betraying the community

**Conspiracy thinking:** "They exposed it as hoax to cover up the truth!" reverses cause and effect

**Financial incentives:** Books, documentaries, and lectures keep the story alive for profit

These psychological factors explain persistence better than any "hidden truth."

### The Lesson

Aztec teaches that the UFO field must:
- **Demand evidence** (not just stories)
- **Verify sources** (not trust charisma)
- **Accept correction** (not double down on debunked claims)
- **Reject fraud** (not rehabilitate con men)
- **Maintain skepticism** (even within the believer community)

If UFO researchers can't reject obvious hoaxes like Aztec, how can they claim credibility investigating ambiguous cases?

### The Verdict

Aztec is a fraud. Completely. Utterly. Provably.

Anyone still promoting it is harming UFO research and demonstrating either ignorance or dishonesty.

**THE VERDICT:** Total hoax, legally convicted fraud, no credibility whatsoever. Important only as cautionary tale about how easily people are fooled and how hard it is to kill a lie once it's in circulation.

## 🎬 PRODUCTION NOTES

### Related Episodes
- Episode 1: Roswell (the crash that inspired Aztec hoax)
- Episode 42: Majestic 12 (another elaborate hoax/forgery)
- Episode 60: David Grusch (modern claims requiring scrutiny)

### X-Files Connection
"Jose Chung's From Outer Space" (Season 3) brilliantly satirizes UFO fraud and how stories get embellished, misremembered, and exploited. The episode features con men, fake scientists, and narratives that shift based on who's telling them—exactly what happened with Aztec.

"The End" (Season 5) features a fraudulent psychic exploiting people's need to believe, paralleling how Newton and GeBauer exploited UFO enthusiasm.

The X-Files warned viewers to "Trust No One"—good advice when evaluating UFO claims.

### Additional Context
- The Aztec crash allegedly occurred March 25, 1948 (date varies in different tellings)
- Frank Scully's book sold over 60,000 copies initially
- Newton and GeBauer's fraud scheme netted over $200,000 (equivalent to ~$2.5 million today)
- The Aztec UFO Symposium still occurs annually in Aztec, New Mexico (tourist economy)
- Some local Aztec businesses embrace the story for tourism despite it being debunked
- The case is studied in fraud investigation courses as an example of confidence schemes

### Why This Episode Matters

Aztec is critically important as a cautionary tale about UFO fraud. It demonstrates how charismatic con men can exploit public fascination, how mainstream media can spread false narratives, and how debunked stories persist despite overwhelming contrary evidence. The case tests the UFO community's ability to self-correct and reject obvious frauds. The fact that some researchers still defend Aztec decades after legal conviction shows how psychological and financial factors can override evidence, undermining serious UFO research.
