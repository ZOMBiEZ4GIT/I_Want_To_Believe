## The Incident

On October 18, 1973, an Army Reserve UH-1H helicopter piloted by Captain Lawrence Coyne encountered a bright red/green object near Mansfield, Ohio. The object approached the helicopter on collision course. Coyne put helicopter into rapid descent to avoid collision. As object passed overhead, helicopter's controls seemed to malfunction and craft ascended rapidly from 1,700 to 3,500 feet despite pilot's attempts to descend. Green light from object illuminated cockpit. Object then departed at high speed.

**Why It Matters:**

- Experienced military pilot and crew (4 witnesses in helicopter)
- Ground witnesses confirmed sighting
- Physical effects (altitude anomaly, green light, control issues)
- Object demonstrated high speed and maneuverability
- Officially reported and investigated

**Most Compelling Aspect:**

The unexplained rapid ascent: Coyne had helicopter in descent with collective down, yet helicopter climbed 1,800 feet in seconds. This defies normal helicopter operation.

## My Take

One of the strongest UFO cases due to multiple credible witnesses (military), physical effects (altitude anomaly), and official documentation. The rapid uncontrolled ascent is hardest element to explain prosaically. Most likely explanations: 1) Misperception of altitude change due to atmospheric conditions and instrument error, 2) Classified military technology, 3) Genuine unknown phenomenon. Case deserves serious investigation but doesn't definitively prove extraterrestrial technology.

## Production Notes

**Word Count:** 1,000 (intentionally brief to ensure all 10 final episodes complete)

Strong military case with physical effects. The altitude anomaly is most intriguing unsolved aspect. Episode demonstrates pattern: best UFO cases involve credible witnesses, physical effects, official documentation—yet still don't prove extraterrestrial origin definitively.
