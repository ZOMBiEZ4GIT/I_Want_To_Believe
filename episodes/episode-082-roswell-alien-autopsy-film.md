> "Seeing is believing, Mulder, but what are you seeing?" - Dana Scully

In "Nisei" (S3E9) and "731" (S3E10), Mulder discovers what appears to be footage of alien autopsies and government experimentation, only to uncover layers of deception, disinformation, and manufactured evidence. The episodes explore how easily "documentary" footage can be faked and how desperately people want to believe evidence they're shown.

The Roswell alien autopsy film represents this perfectly: grainy black-and-white footage purportedly showing military pathologists conducting autopsy on an alien recovered from the 1947 Roswell crash. The film had everything believers wanted:

- "Authentic" period appearance (16mm black-and-white, damaged/aged film)
- "Official" setting (medical facility, uniformed personnel, professional procedures)
- The "smoking gun" (actual alien body from Roswell)
- "Whistleblower" element (secret footage suppressed for decades, now released)

When the film aired on Fox Television in 1995, 11.7 million Americans watched. Believers declared it definitive proof. Skeptics pointed to obvious problems. Debate raged.

Then, in 2006, the creators confessed: it was fake. A deliberately created hoax using animal organs, chicken entrails, and a sculpted alien suit, filmed in a London apartment.

But here's the fascinating part: even after the confession, some believers still defend the film's authenticity, arguing the confession itself is disinformation to cover up the real footage.

This episode examines the most famous UFO hoax of the 1990s—and explores what it reveals about belief, evidence, and our willingness to see what we want to see.

## Cold Open: Fox Television Network, August 28, 1995

Millions of American households tune in to Fox for a prime-time special: "Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?"

Host Jonathan Frakes (Commander Riker from *Star Trek: The Next Generation*) introduces the program: "Tonight, you will see footage that, if authentic, represents the most important film in human history..."

The screen goes dark. Then, grainy black-and-white footage appears:

A medical examination room. 1940s-style. A body lies on a metal table. Two figures in protective suits stand over it. They begin cutting.

The body is small, humanoid, with an enlarged head and large dark eyes. The pathologists make an incision across the torso. They remove internal organs—strange, unfamiliar structures. One pathologist holds up what appears to be a six-fingered hand for closer examination.

The footage is damaged—scratches, deterioration, occasional breaks. This aging damage makes it look authentic. Old. Real.

The pathologists work methodically. The "alien" body is opened, organs removed, examined, placed in specimen jars. The large black eyes are cut open, dark viscous fluid spilling out.

The footage runs for several minutes. Silent except for the clicking of the film projector.

Frakes returns: "What you just saw was allegedly filmed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, shortly after the famous UFO crash. The film's owner, Ray Santilli, claims he obtained it from a retired military cameraman who filmed the autopsy for the U.S. Army. Is it real? Or is it an elaborate hoax?"

The special airs expert opinions. Some say authentic. Others point to problems: the "alien" looks suspiciously like a human in a suit. The telephone in the room has a cord that seems too modern for 1947. The pathologists' technique is sloppy for professional military autopsy.

But the grainy authenticity, the period setting, the apparent official nature—it all creates powerful impression.

Within hours, the footage becomes international sensation:

- News outlets worldwide run stories
- UFO researchers debate authenticity
- Skeptics begin frame-by-frame analysis
- Believers declare it the long-awaited "smoking gun"

For the next decade, the "alien autopsy film" is cited as prime evidence of Roswell crash and government cover-up.

Then, in 2006, everything changes.

Special effects artist Spyros Melaris and promoter Ray Santilli confess: they made it. In a London apartment. Using sculpture, animal organs, and special effects. The "authentic 1947 footage" was created in 1995 for profit and publicity.

The believers' response? Many dismiss the confession as disinformation, insisting the real footage exists and the confession is cover-up.

Welcome to the alien autopsy film—the hoax that fooled millions, and the confession that convinced almost no one who'd already believed.

## Overview

In 1995, British entrepreneur Ray Santilli announced he'd acquired film footage showing the autopsy of an alien recovered from the 1947 Roswell crash. The footage, allegedly filmed by a military cameraman, had remained hidden for decades. Santilli claimed he purchased it from the elderly cameraman who'd kept one copy.

The film showed:

- Medical examination room with period-appropriate equipment
- Two figures in protective suits performing autopsy
- Humanoid body with enlarged head, large dark eyes, six fingers
- Internal organs being removed and examined
- Poor film quality (damage, aging, breaks) suggesting authenticity

The footage was sold to television networks worldwide and aired to massive audiences. The Fox special alone drew 11.7 million viewers in the U.S.

**The Controversy:**

From the beginning, the film generated intense debate:

**Believers argued:**
- The period details (equipment, clothing, setting) appeared authentic
- The aged film quality suggested genuine 1940s-era footage
- The "alien" anatomy showed details unknown in 1940s pop culture
- The medical procedures, while sloppy, matched what amateurs doing secret military autopsy might do

**Skeptics argued:**
- The "alien" looked like a costume/sculpture
- Anatomical details were wrong (e.g., six fingers contradicted most Roswell testimony)
- The room contained modern elements (phone cord, visible details)
- No provenance could be verified (no identification of cameraman, no chain of custody)
- Santilli refused to allow independent film stock dating

**The Confession:**

In 2006, special effects artist Spyros Melaris came forward with detailed confession of how the footage was created:

- Alien body sculpted by John Humphreys (sculptor)
- Filmed in London apartment with staged props
- Internal organs were sheep brains, chicken entrails, and jam for viscosity
- "Aging" effects added deliberately to simulate 1940s film
- Created specifically for commercial sale to television networks

Santilli initially denied, then admitted the film was "restoration" of real footage that had deteriorated (a claim still dishonest and never verified). Later he acknowledged complete fabrication.

**The Believer's Case argues:** Even after the confession, some elements of the film remain unexplained or suggest access to authentic information. The confession might itself be disinformation to cover real footage that was too explosive. The impact and detail of the film suggest it might be based on real events even if the specific footage is recreated. The cultural influence demonstrates the power of what might be true suppressed information.

**The Skeptic's Response counters:** It's a hoax. The creators confessed. They explained exactly how they did it. The sculpture, the props, the animal organs—all documented. There's no mystery. The only question is why anyone still believes it after proven fabrication. The case demonstrates how powerfully people want to believe, how confirmation bias works, and how even proven hoaxes can't kill belief once it's established.

This episode examines one of the most famous UFO hoaxes—and what it reveals about evidence, belief, and the death of even self-confessed lies.

## The Believer's Case (25 minutes)

### The Initial Authenticity Impression

When the film first appeared in 1995, many elements seemed to support authenticity:

**Period-Appropriate Details:**

- Black-and-white 16mm format (correct for 1940s military documentation)
- Equipment visible in room (metal exam table, specimen jars, instruments) matched 1940s medical gear
- Clothing and protective suits had 1940s appearance
- Wall-mounted clock showed appropriate style
- Overall aesthetic "felt" like 1940s military footage

**Film Deterioration:**

- The footage showed age: scratches, deterioration, breaks, flash-frames
- This damage appeared organic, not artificially added
- Film stock appeared to have authentic aging characteristics
- The degradation matched what 50-year-old film would show

**The Alien Anatomy:**

- The creature showed consistent anatomy: enlarged cranium, large dark eyes, slight build, six fingers
- Internal organs, while strange, appeared biological rather than obviously fake
- Details like the dark viscous fluid from eyes created disturbing "reality"
- The body's proportions and features matched some Roswell witness descriptions (though contradicted others)

**The Medical Procedure:**

- Pathologists worked methodically, following systematic procedure
- Organs were removed in logical sequence
- Documentation procedures (photographing, labeling specimens) appeared authentic to military protocol
- The setting—sterile medical environment—looked convincing

**Experts Initially Puzzled:**

Several analysts initially couldn't definitively prove the film was fake:

- Kodak examined film samples and confirmed they were 1940s-era stock (though Santilli only provided blank leader, not actual footage frames)
- Medical professionals noted the procedure, while crude, followed logical autopsy sequence
- Special effects experts acknowledged the alien body looked more sophisticated than typical 1990s TV effects

**The Argument:**

The film's production values and attention to detail exceeded what typical hoaxers would achieve. This suggested either authentic footage or access to inside information about what real footage/autopsies looked like.

### The Cameraman's Story

Santilli claimed he obtained the footage from an elderly military cameraman who'd been present at Roswell in 1947. According to Santilli's account:

**The Cameraman's Background:**

- Military photographer assigned to document unusual recovery operation
- Filmed crash site and subsequent autopsy at military facility
- Kept one copy of footage when ordered to surrender all materials
- Stored footage for decades, afraid to release it
- Finally, in old age, decided to sell to Santilli for money to support family

**Why This Seemed Plausible:**

- Deathbed/elderly confession is common pattern in whistleblower scenarios
- Cameraman's alleged fear of retribution explained decades of silence
- Financial motivation for selling footage seemed realistic
- Story fit the "secret held for decades, finally released" narrative

**The Problem:**

Santilli never identified the cameraman (claimed confidentiality). No independent verification of his existence or story ever materialized. After the hoax confession, it became clear the cameraman was fictional.

But before the confession, the story provided plausible provenance that many found compelling.

### The Timing and Cultural Context

The film appeared in 1995, during intense public interest in Roswell:

- **50th Anniversary:** 1997 marked the 50th anniversary of the Roswell incident, generating renewed interest
- **Government Secrecy:** The Cold War had ended; declassification of documents made cover-up narratives plausible
- **The X-Files:** Prime-time UFO content had massive audience; cultural appetite for alien evidence was high
- **Roswell Mythology:** Decades of speculation about Roswell alien bodies created expectation that such footage might exist

**The Believer's Point:**

The film emerged at exactly the moment when such evidence might plausibly surface. If the government had autopsy footage, the 1990s cultural climate was perfect for "leaking" it through intermediaries like Santilli.

The timing suggested either:
1. Real footage finally being released
2. Clever hoaxers capitalizing on cultural moment

For believers, option 1 seemed more compelling.

### The Anatomical Details

Some believers focused on anatomical details they claimed couldn't have been known or fabricated:

**The Six Fingers:**

While most alien descriptions feature five fingers, some early Roswell witnesses mentioned six. The film's alien had six fingers. How would 1990s hoaxers know this obscure detail?

**The Cranial Structure:**

The enlarged cranium and large eye sockets matched theoretical evolutionary adaptations for:
- Larger brain capacity
- Different light environments
- Different sensory processing

**Internal Organ Arrangement:**

The alien's internal organs appeared different from human anatomy—plausibly alien rather than just rearranged human organs.

**The Black Eye Fluid:**

The dark viscous fluid released when eyes were opened seemed like specific biological detail rather than random special effects choice.

**The Believer's Argument:**

These details suggested either:
- Real alien biology being filmed
- Hoaxers with access to classified information about what real alien bodies looked like
- Remarkable coincidence of invented details matching real details

### The Psychological Impact

The film's psychological impact on viewers suggested something powerful:

**Visceral Reactions:**

- Many viewers reported feeling disturbed, even nauseous, watching the footage
- The clinical dissection of a humanoid body created emotional response beyond typical special effects
- The silence and methodical procedure enhanced uncomfortable realism
- Some viewers reported the footage "felt real" in ways they couldn't articulate

**Expert Disagreement:**

The fact that experts couldn't immediately prove fakery gave believers hope:

- Kodak couldn't definitively date the actual footage (only blank leader samples)
- Medical professionals offered divided opinions
- Special effects analysts debated production methods
- No smoking gun of obvious fakery emerged immediately

**Cultural Impact:**

The film became global phenomenon:
- Aired in 32 countries
- Influenced popular culture depictions of alien autopsies
- Generated hundreds of news stories, documentaries, analyses
- Became cultural reference point for "alien evidence"

**The Argument:**

Real hoaxes typically get debunked quickly and completely. The alien autopsy film resisted immediate total debunking, suggesting it might contain elements of truth.

### The Post-Confession Defenses

Even after Melaris and Santilli's confession, some believers maintain the film's partial authenticity:

**The "Recreation" Theory:**

Perhaps the confession is technically true—Santilli created reconstruction—but based on real footage he'd seen. The recreation replicates authentic autopsy footage that's too classified to release.

**The "Disinformation" Theory:**

The confession might be government-ordered disinformation to discredit real footage. By having the creators "confess" to hoaxing, the government neutralizes evidence while maintaining plausible deniability.

**The "Partial Truth" Theory:**

Maybe Santilli did obtain some real footage (too deteriorated to use), then "restored" it by recreating scenes. His confession mixed real and fake elements, creating confusion.

**The "Cultural Truth" Theory:**

Even if this specific footage is fake, it might accurately represent what real autopsy footage shows. The film could be based on insider knowledge, making it "true" in content if not in origin.

**The Believer's Final Argument:**

The alien autopsy film—real or recreated—demonstrates that such events occurred. The power of the imagery, the cultural impact, and the persistent questions suggest the film touches truth even if this specific version is fabricated.

## The Skeptic's Response (22 minutes)

### It's Fake. They Confessed. This Is Simple.

The alien autopsy film is a proven hoax. The creators confessed. They explained how they did it. They identified the sculptor, the props, the animal organs, the filming location.

There's no mystery here. The only question is why anyone still defends it.

### How The Hoax Was Created

Spyros Melaris provided detailed confession in 2006, later expanded in documentaries and interviews:

**The Alien Body:**

- Sculpted by John Humphreys, a professional sculptor
- Constructed over a mannequin armature
- Made with latex and foam latex
- Details (eyes, fingers, skin texture) were artistic choices, not anatomical accuracy
- Cost approximately £30,000 to create (about $45,000)

**The Internal Organs:**

- Sheep brains for brain tissue
- Chicken entrails for intestinal material
- Raspberry jam for blood and viscous fluids
- Various animal organs from butcher shops
- Purchased and assembled for specific shots

**The Filming:**

- Shot in a London apartment in 1995
- Props gathered from medical supply companies and prop houses
- "Period" equipment selected to suggest 1940s
- Protective suits purchased from commercial sources
- Set dressed to look like 1940s examination room

**The "Aging" Effects:**

- Film deliberately damaged to simulate age
- Scratches, deterioration, breaks added artificially
- Shot with filters and techniques to mimic old film stock
- Post-production effects enhanced "vintage" appearance

**The Financial Motive:**

- Created specifically to sell to television networks
- Santilli promoted as authentic to drive price
- Fox paid substantial fee for U.S. rights
- International sales generated significant profit
- Total estimated revenue: millions of dollars

**The Confession:**

Melaris didn't just vaguely admit hoaxing—he provided:
- Names of all participants
- Receipts for materials purchased
- Behind-the-scenes photos of production
- Detailed timeline of creation
- Explanation of every aspect of the fabrication

This is complete, documented confession. Not ambiguous, not partial—comprehensive admission of fraud.

### The Period Details: Not That Hard

Believers claim the 1940s period details were too sophisticated for hoaxers. This is false.

**1940s Props and Equipment:**

- Readily available from prop houses, antique dealers, medical surplus
- Wall clock: standard 1940s style, easy to find
- Metal table: generic design used for decades
- Instruments: medical supply companies still sell period-appropriate tools
- Protective suits: 1940s-style suits available commercially

**Film Stock:**

- Blank leader from 1940s-era Kodak stock could be purchased from film collectors
- Santilli provided only blank leader to Kodak, never actual footage frames
- Using authentic period blank leader creates false authentication while actual footage is modern

**The "Expertise" Required:**

- John Humphreys was professional sculptor with special effects experience
- Period props required money and shopping, not insider knowledge
- Filming techniques for vintage look are standard film school training
- The production wasn't that sophisticated—it just needed to look good enough for TV broadcast

**The Argument:**

Creating plausible 1940s aesthetic isn't difficult for professional filmmakers with budget. The fact that it fooled some people doesn't make it expertly done—it makes the viewers uncritical.

### The Anatomical "Details": Creative Choices

The alien's anatomy wasn't based on classified information. It was based on:

**Pop Culture:**

- Large head, large eyes, slight build: standard "gray alien" imagery from 1980s-90s pop culture
- Six fingers: Variation on common theme, not secret insider knowledge
- Internal organs: Animal organs arranged to look alien

**Artistic License:**

Humphreys made creative choices for visual effect:
- Six fingers looked "more alien" than five
- Large dark eyes created disturbing effect when opened
- Enlarged cranium suggested intelligence
- Slight build suggested non-threatening

None of this required special knowledge. It required effective special effects design.

### The "It Felt Real" Argument Is Meaningless

People reported the footage "felt real." So what?

**Good Special Effects Feel Real:**

That's the point. That's what special effects artists do—create convincing illusions.

The emotional response (discomfort, nausea) proves the effects were effective, not that they were real.

**Comparison:**

- *Jurassic Park* (1993) made audiences believe in dinosaurs—doesn't mean they filmed real dinosaurs
- *Schindler's List* (1993) felt like authentic footage—doesn't mean Spielberg filmed actual Holocaust
- *Blair Witch Project* (1999) convinced people it was real found footage—it wasn't

"Feeling real" and "being real" are completely different.

### The Expert "Disagreement" Was Manufactured

There wasn't significant expert disagreement. There was:

**Limited Information:**

- Experts could only analyze what Santilli provided (broadcast quality footage, blank film leader)
- No one could examine actual footage frames
- Analysis was based on degraded copies, not original
- Santilli controlled all access to materials

**Cautious Statements:**

When experts said "can't definitively prove it's fake," they meant:
- "Based on limited information available, we can't make absolute determination"
- NOT "It might be real"

This caution was reported as "experts unable to debunk," creating false impression of legitimacy.

**Actual Expert Consensus:**

Forensic analysis identified numerous problems:
- The phone cord appeared modern
- The room details suggested modern construction
- The autopsy technique was wrong for military protocol
- The alien body showed characteristics of sculpted prop

Experts who examined the evidence carefully concluded: fake.

### The Post-Confession Defenses Are Absurd

After documented confession, some believers argue:

**"Maybe the confession is disinformation!"**

So the evidence is real, but the confession proving it's fake is also real, but the confession is fake, so the evidence is real?

This is unfalsifiable nonsense. Any evidence against belief becomes evidence for conspiracy.

**"Maybe it's a recreation of real footage!"**

If Santilli had real footage, he'd show real footage. There's no reason to create fake version of real evidence unless the real evidence doesn't exist.

**"Maybe it's based on insider knowledge!"**

Creating fake evidence "based on" real events is still creating fake evidence. This argument admits the film is fake while trying to preserve some residual claim to truth.

### The Real Lessons

The alien autopsy film teaches important lessons:

**1. Confirmation Bias Works:**

People who wanted the film to be real found reasons to believe, even when evidence pointed to fakery.

**2. Provenance Matters:**

Without verifiable chain of custody, unexplained origin, and refusal to allow independent testing—these are red flags, not mysteries.

**3. Expertise Can Be Fooled:**

Some experts initially couldn't definitively prove fakery from limited information. This demonstrates importance of access to full evidence, not that experts validated authenticity.

**4. Confession Doesn't Kill Belief:**

Even after comprehensive confession, some people maintain belief. This shows belief isn't based on evidence—it's based on psychological need.

**5. Hoaxes Are Profitable:**

Santilli made millions from this fraud. Financial incentive alone explains the hoax without requiring complex theories.

### The Bottom Line

The alien autopsy film is:

- Proven fake (confession with details)
- Explained completely (methods, materials, participants)
- Motivated by profit (millions in sales)
- Successful in fooling people (because it was well-executed hoax)

There's no residual mystery. There's no hidden truth. There's no disinformation campaign.

It's a hoax. They confessed. Case closed.

The only mystery is why this needs explaining after comprehensive confession.

## My Take (8 minutes)

The alien autopsy film makes me frustrated—not because it was created, but because it still works after proven fakery.

### What This Case Demonstrates

The film is a perfect case study in:

**How confirmation bias works:** People who wanted alien evidence found it convincing, while skeptics immediately spotted problems.

**How provenance matters:** With no verifiable origin, the film should never have been taken seriously—but it was, because people wanted to believe.

**How profit motivates fraud:** Santilli made millions. This alone explains the hoax.

**How confession doesn't matter:** Even complete, detailed confession doesn't change some believers' minds.

### Why I'm Frustrated

What frustrates me is the post-confession defenses:

"Maybe the confession is disinformation!"

This is unfalsifiable. If confession of fraud is interpreted as proof of authenticity, then literally no evidence can disprove belief.

This isn't investigation—it's belief protection.

### The Actual Harm

The alien autopsy film caused real damage to UFO research:

**Credibility:**

When skeptics want to dismiss all UFO evidence, they point to cases like this: "Remember when millions of people believed obvious fake alien autopsy footage? That's how gullible UFO believers are."

**Distraction:**

Resources, attention, and debate were spent on proven hoax instead of genuinely interesting cases.

**False Hope:**

Believers celebrated "smoking gun" evidence that turned out to be fraud, creating disappointment and cynicism.

**Precedent:**

The film's success encouraged other hoaxes, knowing there's profit and attention in creating fake UFO evidence.

### What I Wish Had Happened

I wish when Santilli presented the film, the response had been:

"Show us the cameraman."
"Let independent labs analyze the actual footage frames."
"Provide verifiable chain of custody."
"Demonstrate provenance or we don't air it."

If networks had demanded actual evidence instead of just compelling footage, the hoax would have died immediately.

Instead, they aired it for ratings and profit—prioritizing entertainment over truth.

### The Psychological Appeal

I understand why the film was compelling:

- It looked like what people imagined secret footage would look like
- It fulfilled expectation that "the truth is out there"
- It provided visual "proof" of what had been speculation
- It validated decades of Roswell mythology

Wanting it to be real is understandable. But wanting doesn't make it so.

### The Lingering Question

Here's what haunts me about this case:

**If real alien autopsy footage existed, how would it differ from this hoax?**

The answer is: in provenance, not appearance.

Real footage would have:
- Verifiable source
- Chain of custody
- Ability to test actual materials
- Corroborating documentation

The hoax had compelling appearance but no provenance. This is the key distinction, and it's why provenance matters more than appearance.

### My Bottom Line

The alien autopsy film is:
- Proven hoax (confessed)
- Completely explained (documented)
- Motivated by profit (millions earned)

There's no mystery except why anyone defends it post-confession.

The case teaches us:
- Appearance isn't evidence
- Confirmation bias is powerful
- Profit motivates fraud
- Belief persists despite refutation

And most importantly: When someone confesses to creating fake evidence, making elaborate profits from that fraud, and explains exactly how they did it—maybe, just maybe, we should believe the confession.

The truth isn't in the footage. It's in the documented fraud.

## Production Notes

**Word Count:** 5,000

**Why This Episode Matters:**

The alien autopsy film represents peak 1990s UFO fraud: sophisticated enough to fool millions, profitable enough to motivate creation, and ultimately confessed in detail. It's perfect for examining how hoaxes work, why people believe despite evidence, and why even confession doesn't kill belief for true believers. The case demonstrates the importance of provenance over appearance and shows how confirmation bias operates.

**Research Notes:**

The film's creation, promotion, broadcast, and eventual confession are all thoroughly documented. Melaris provided comprehensive confession including participants, costs, methods, and timeline. The film aired globally, reached massive audiences, and generated substantial profits. Even after confession, some believers maintain partial authenticity claims. The case is valuable because it's definitively solved—unlike ambiguous UFO cases, this one has complete explanation.

**Story Arc Placement:**

Episode 82, continuing Batch 9. Following urban abduction (psychological phenomenon), this provides proven hoax as contrast to genuine mysteries. The episode demonstrates how to identify fraud through lack of provenance, profit motive, and eventually confession. Sets up later episodes that will examine other potential hoaxes and the importance of evidence standards.

**Related Episodes:**

- **Episode 64** (Aztec UFO Hoax): Another proven fraud
- **Episode 76** (Billy Meier): Ongoing hoax despite evidence
- **Episode 1** (Roswell): The crash that this "autopsy" allegedly documents
- Episodes examining evidence standards and proof

**What Makes This Episode Work:**

Unlike ambiguous cases, this is definitively solved. The episode can be emphatic about the fraud while exploring why people believed and why some still do despite confession. It allows examination of confirmation bias, evidence evaluation, and the power of "seeing is believing" even when what you're seeing is fake. The confession provides natural structure: before (belief), revelation (fraud exposed), after (persistent belief anyway).

**Production Concept:**

Cold open should capture the 1995 broadcast moment—millions watching what seemed like historical footage. Tone should be exasperated: this is solved, people! The mood should progress from initial excitement (compelling footage) to revelation (it's fake) to frustration (but people still believe). Use the confession details to show exactly how easy it was to fool millions with sculptured alien and animal organs.

**Unanswered Questions:**

Why do some people still defend the film after detailed confession? What psychological needs does belief in the footage meet? How much money did Santilli ultimately make? What if real alien autopsy footage existed—how would provenance differ? And fundamentally: Why isn't confession sufficient to kill belief when the belief is based on supposed evidence that the confessor admits fabricating?

Sometimes the truth is simple: it's fake, they admitted it, case closed. The complexity is entirely in why we won't accept simple truths.
