3. **[ESSENTIAL] Episode 13: The Tic Tac UAP** - Fast forward to 2004. Navy pilots, Pentagon confirmation, multiple sensors. The best modern evidence.

**Then continue with these highlights:**
4. **[ESSENTIAL] Episode 18: Rendlesham Forest** - Britain's Roswell. Multiple military witnesses at a nuclear base.
5. **[RECOMMENDED] Episode 5: Phoenix Lights** - Thousands witnessed it. Governor saw it. Still unexplained.
6. **[RECOMMENDED] Episode 7: Travis Walton** - Logging crew witnesses abduction. Passed polygraphs. Controversial and compelling.
7. **[ESSENTIAL] Episode 3: Project Blue Book** - The government's 17-year investigation. 701 cases unsolved.

**Modern disclosure context:**
8. **[ESSENTIAL] Episode 60: David Grusch** - 2023 whistleblower testimony to Congress. "We have craft of non-human origin."

## PATH 7: ANCIENT ALIENS EXPLORATION
**Did they visit our ancestors?**

**The Theorist:**

## PATH 9: SCHOOL SIGHTINGS - CHILDREN AS WITNESSES
**When kids see the impossible**

1. **Episode 29/99: Ariel School, Zimbabwe (1994)** - 62 children see craft land, beings communicate telepathically about environmental destruction. Interviewed separately, consistent stories.
