## WHAT TO NEVER READ (SERIOUSLY)

**DON'T Read These (Until Much Later):**

❌ **All 100 episode briefs at once**
- You'll overwhelm yourself
- Read ONE at a time

❌ **All 100 full frameworks**
- That's like reading 10 books
- Reference while recording only

❌ **Business/monetization guides** (until episode 20+)
- `05-PRODUCTION-GUIDES/monetization-guide.md` - SKIP for now
- `05-PRODUCTION-GUIDES/business-plan.md` - SKIP for now
- Focus on creating first, monetizing later

❌ **Advanced production guides** (until episode 10+)
- `08-ADVANCED/` folder - SKIP entirely for now
- `05-PRODUCTION-GUIDES/distribution-guide.md` - SKIP until you have 5+ episodes

- Read the basics, then DO
- Learn by doing

**TRAP 3: "Let me research the best microphone/software/approach"**
- Research paralysis
- Pick anything decent and START
- Optimize later

**TRAP 4: "I should read episodes in order"**
- No! Pick easy ones first
- Build confidence

## FINAL READING RULE

Don't let reading become procrastination.
