## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**Before Recording:**
- ❌ Not testing equipment (catches problems too late)
- ❌ Recording in noisy environment
- ❌ Not reading materials first
- ❌ Forgetting to turn off notifications

**During Recording:**
- ❌ Not saving frequently (risk losing work)
- ❌ Recording too long without breaks (voice fatigue)
- ❌ Re-recording entire sections for tiny mistakes
- ❌ Not drinking water (dry mouth = clicks and pops)

**After Recording:**
- ❌ Not backing up files (catastrophic if lost)
- ❌ Editing immediately when tired
- ❌ Over-editing (sterilizing natural speech)
- ❌ Not tracking progress (motivation killer)

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** Background noise in recording
**Solution:**
- Stop and address the noise source
- Record in different time/location
- Use noise reduction in post

**Problem:** Volume too low/high
**Solution:**
- Adjust input gain before re-recording
- Normalize in post-production
- Move closer/farther from mic

**Problem:** Voice sounds muffled
**Solution:**
- Check mic positioning (not speaking directly into it)
- Adjust EQ in post (boost high frequencies)
- Check for obstructions (pop filter too thick?)

**Problem:** Mouth clicks and pops
**Solution:**
- Drink more water
- Avoid dairy before recording
- Position mic slightly off-axis
- Edit out in post

**Problem:** Can't focus during recording
**Solution:**
- Take a 10-minute break
- Do some physical movement
- Switch to different section
- Reschedule if genuinely not working

**Problem:** Hating your voice
**Solution:**
- Everyone hates their voice at first
- It gets better with practice
- Focus on content, not sound
- Listen to Episode 1 vs. Episode 10 - you'll hear improvement
