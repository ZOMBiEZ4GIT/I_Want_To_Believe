## MOST COMMON MISTAKES

**❌ Reading everything before starting**
- Don't read all 100 episode briefs
- Don't read all the guides
- Just pick ONE episode and go

**❌ Aiming for perfection**
- Your first episode will be rough
- That's normal
- Done > perfect

**❌ Starting with the hardest episode**
- Don't start with Episode 1 (Roswell is massive)
- Pick an easy one from the quick-wins list
- Build confidence first

**❌ Recording without prep**
- Always read the brief and recording notes first
- 20 minutes of prep saves hours of confusion

**❌ Not tracking progress**
- Update COMPLETION-TRACKER.md
- Seeing progress = motivation

## WHEN YOU GET STUCK

**Can't start?**
→ Just read ONE episode brief. That's it. Don't record, just read.

**Overwhelmed?**
→ Go to `06-QUICK-WINS/5-minute-tasks.md` and do ONE thing.

**Lost motivation?**
→ Listen to one of your completed episodes. Remember why you're doing this.

**Perfectionism paralysis?**
→ Set a timer for 2 hours. When it goes off, you're done editing.

**Everything feels impossible?**
→ Read `00-START-HERE/ADHD-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md` section on troubleshooting.

## THE WEEKLY RHYTHM (Once You're Rolling)

**Monday:** Pick next episode, read brief
**Tuesday:** Prep and practice
**Wednesday:** Record episode
**Thursday:** Edit episode
**Friday:** Export and publish
**Weekend:** Rest or batch prep

1-2 episodes per week = **50-100 episodes in a year.**

You can do this.
