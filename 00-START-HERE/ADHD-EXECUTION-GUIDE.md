# THE ADHD EXECUTION GUIDE
## How to Actually Record 100 Podcast Episodes (Without Burning Out)

**READ THIS FIRST. SERIOUSLY.**

If you're here, you have ADHD (diagnosed or not) and you've looked at this massive repository of research and thought "I'm going to record all 100 episodes!" followed immediately by "Oh god, where do I even start?"

This guide is your answer.

## WHY THIS SYSTEM EXISTS

### The Problem

You have:
- ✅ 100 episodes worth of incredible research
- ✅ A burning desire to create this podcast
- ✅ The skills and intelligence to pull it off
- ❌ The executive function to start/maintain/finish

Traditional project management doesn't work for ADHD brains. You need:
- **Dopamine optimization** (rewards at every step)
- **Friction reduction** (make starting as easy as possible)
- **Brain-state matching** (different tasks for different energy levels)
- **Visual progress tracking** (see your wins)
- **Forgiveness systems** (missing a day doesn't kill momentum)

### The Solution

This repository has been reorganized into an ADHD-optimized production system:

**NOT** an archive of research (though it contains that)
**NOT** a reference library (though you can use it that way)
**IS** a turn-key system for recording 100 episodes without overwhelming yourself

## WHAT TO IGNORE (FOR NOW)

### DO NOT READ:
- ❌ All 100 full frameworks (you'll never start)
- ❌ Business and monetization guides (future problem)
- ❌ Advanced production guides (you'll learn by doing)
- ❌ Every episode brief (just the one you're recording)

### DO READ:
- ✅ This file (ADHD-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md)
- ✅ QUICK-START-GUIDE.md (TL;DR version)
- ✅ READING-ORDER.md (what to read when)
- ✅ One episode brief at a time

**ADHD TRAP:** Reading everything before starting = productive procrastination.

**SOLUTION:** Read this guide, then go directly to Week 1 learning tasks.

---

## THE LEARNING PHASE: WEEKS 1-4

**YOU'RE NOW READY FOR PRODUCTION MODE.**

---

## PRODUCTION MODE: WEEKS 5+

### The Weekly Rhythm

**You're not recording 100 episodes. You're recording 1-2 episodes per week for a year.**

That's sustainable. That's achievable. That's how you finish.

### Sample Weekly Schedule

**MONDAY - Planning & Prep (1 hour)**
- Pick next episode
- Read brief and recording notes
- Mark up script
- Set weekly goals

**TUESDAY - Research Day (Optional)**
- If needed, dive into full framework
- Make notes for difficult sections
- Practice voices/pronunciations

**WEDNESDAY - Recording Day (2-4 hours)**
- Morning: Best for high-energy cold opens
- Record full episode OR
- Record believer + skeptic sections (finish Thursday)

**THURSDAY - Recording or Editing (2-3 hours)**
- Finish recording if not done, OR
- Edit Wednesday's recording
- Remove mistakes, adjust pacing

**FRIDAY - Polish & Publish (1-2 hours)**
- Final edits
- Add music
- Normalize audio
- Export
- Update trackers
- CELEBRATE

**WEEKEND - Rest or Batch Prep**
- Option 1: Complete rest (recommended every other week)
- Option 2: Batch prep 2-3 episode briefs for upcoming weeks
- Option 3: Record a second episode if you're feeling it

**Weekly XP:** 275-550 XP depending on 1-2 episodes

### Brain-State-Based Task Selection

Your brain doesn't have the same energy every day. Match tasks to your mental state.

**HIGH ENERGY / HYPERFOCUS DAYS:**
- Record believer section (passion and drama)
- Record cold opens (need peak performance)
- Record full episode in one session (if you're in flow)
- Tackle difficult/complex episodes

**MEDIUM ENERGY DAYS:**
- Edit recordings
- Record skeptic section (analytical work)
- Record your take section (reflective)
- Prep upcoming episodes

**LOW ENERGY / SCATTERED DAYS:**
- Read episode briefs
- Update completion trackers
- Organize files
- Mark up recording notes
- Practice pronunciations
- Watch tutorials

**ZERO FOCUS / ROUGH DAYS:**
- Do NOTHING podcast-related
- OR do 5-minute tasks from `06-QUICK-WINS/5-minute-tasks.md`
- Forgiveness is built into the system
- Missing a day doesn't ruin momentum

### Batching vs. Focus

**Batching** (doing multiple similar tasks together):
- ✅ Read 3-5 episode briefs in one session
- ✅ Edit 2-3 episodes back-to-back
- ✅ Record all cold opens for the week
- ❌ Record 3 full episodes in a day (burnout risk)

**Single-Focus** (one episode start to finish):
- ✅ Deep engagement with material
- ✅ Better narrative flow
- ✅ More satisfying completion
- ❌ Can feel slow if you're in hyperfocus mode

**Experiment and find what works for YOU.**

## TROUBLESHOOTING ADHD CHALLENGES

### "I Can't Start"

**Symptoms:**
- Staring at episode list
- Reading briefs but not recording
- "Researching equipment" for the 10th time
- Everything feels too big

**Solutions:**

**5-Minute Rule:** Commit to just 5 minutes. Set a timer. Read ONE episode brief. Often, starting creates momentum.

**Reduce Friction:**
- Leave recording setup ready to go
- Have your marked-up script open
- Queue up the episode framework
- Remove ALL barriers between you and "record"

**Pick the Easiest Task:**
- Don't record - just read a brief
- Don't record a full episode - just record the cold open
- Don't record - just practice one difficult pronunciation

**Accountability:**
- Tell someone you're recording today
- Post on social media "Starting episode X"
- Join a podcasting community

**Remember:** Starting is the hardest part. Once you press record, flow often follows.

### "I'm Overwhelmed"

**Symptoms:**
- Looking at "100 episodes" and freezing
- Too many choices (which episode?)
- Too much information
- Feeling paralyzed

**Solutions:**

**Narrow Your Focus:**
- You're not recording 100 episodes today
- You're recording ONE episode
- Actually, you're just recording the cold open
- Actually, you're just reading the brief

**Use the Quick-Wins List:**
- Go to `06-QUICK-WINS/5-minute-tasks.md`
- Do ONE thing
- Check it off
- Dopamine hit received

**Close Unnecessary Tabs:**
- Open ONLY: episode brief, recording notes, recording software
- Close everything else
- Reduce cognitive load

**Reset:**
- Close your computer
- Walk away for 10 minutes
- Come back and do just ONE task

### "I've Lost Motivation"

**Symptoms:**
- Haven't touched podcast in days/weeks
- Guilt about not working
- Interest has faded
- "What's the point?"

**Solutions:**

**Revisit Your Why:**
- Why did you start this?
- Who is this for?
- What does completing this mean to you?
- Write it down

**Review Your Progress:**
- Look at completed episodes
- Listen to your early vs. recent work
- See how far you've come
- Celebrate the wins

**Lower the Bar:**
- Don't aim for 2 episodes/week
- Aim for 1 episode this month
- Or just prep one episode
- Or just read one brief
- Something > nothing

**Change Your Approach:**
- Record a different episode
- Try a different time of day
- Record in a different location
- Invite a friend to co-record

**Take a Break:**
- Seriously, step away for a week
- Guilt-free rest
- Come back fresh
- The episodes will wait

### "I Started But Can't Finish"

**Symptoms:**
- 47 half-recorded episodes
- Excitement for starting, dread for finishing
- Editing feels impossible
- "I'll finish it later" (you won't)

**Solutions:**

**One Episode at a Time:**
- Don't start a new episode until current is PUBLISHED
- Finishing > starting
- Build the "completion" muscle

**Finish-First Fridays:**
- Every Friday = finish something day
- Pick ONE half-done episode
- Finish and publish it
- No starting new things

**Reduce Scope:**
- "Done" = rough edit + export
- Don't aim for NPR-quality production
- Good enough is GOOD ENOUGH
- You can always remaster later

**Accountability Partner:**
- Tell someone "I'm finishing episode X this week"
- Check in daily
- Report completion

### "Perfectionism Paralysis"

**Symptoms:**
- Re-recording the same section 47 times
- Editing for hours on tiny details
- Never satisfied
- Not publishing because "not good enough"

**Solutions:**

**Set Time Limits:**
- Recording: Max 4 hours per episode
- Editing: Max 2 hours per episode
- When timer goes off, you're done

**The 80/20 Rule:**
- 80% of quality comes from 20% of effort
- First edit = 80% there
- Subsequent edits = diminishing returns
- STOP at "good enough"

**Version 1.0 Mindset:**
- This is V1.0
- You can always re-record later
- Done > perfect
- Your first 10 episodes will be rough - accept it

**Compare to Your Past, Not Others:**
- Don't compare to NPR/Radiolab
- Compare to YOUR episode 1
- Progress > perfection

### "I Keep Getting Distracted"

**Symptoms:**
- Start recording, end up on Reddit
- Research tangents lasting hours
- "Just checking" email/social
- Can't focus for full sessions

**Solutions:**

**Pomodoro Technique:**
- 25 minutes recording
- 5 minutes break
- Repeat
- Longer break after 4 rounds

**Eliminate Distractions:**
- Phone in another room
- Browser extensions blocking social media
- "Do Not Disturb" mode
- Headphones in (even if not playing music)

**Body Doubling:**
- Record while someone else works nearby
- Virtual co-working sessions
- Livestream yourself recording (accountability)

**Movement Breaks:**
- ADHD brains need movement
- Quick walk between sections
- Stretch, jump, dance
- Return refreshed

**Stimulation Management:**
- Some people need background noise
- Some need silence
- Experiment: music? White noise? Nothing?
- Find what works for YOUR brain

## YOUR FIRST 30 DAYS

### Day-by-Day Breakdown

**WEEK 1: SETUP**
- Day 1-2: Equipment and space
- Day 3-4: Skills and practice
- Day 5-7: First test recording

**WEEK 2: FIRST EPISODE**
- Day 8: Choose episode, read brief
- Day 9-10: Prep and practice
- Day 11-13: Record episode
- Day 14: Edit and export

**WEEK 3: SECOND EPISODE**
- Day 15: Choose episode, read brief
- Day 16-17: Prep and record
- Day 18-19: Edit and publish
- Day 20-21: Rest and review

**WEEK 4: ESTABLISH RHYTHM**
- Day 22-26: Record episode 3
- Day 27-28: Batch prep 3 more episodes
- Day 29-30: Review and plan next month

### Realistic Expectations

**After 30 Days, You Will Have:**
- ✅ Recorded 3-4 episodes
- ✅ A working process
- ✅ Identified your challenges
- ✅ Built initial momentum

**You Will NOT Have:**
- ❌ 30 episodes (that's not realistic)
- ❌ Professional-quality production (yet)
- ❌ A perfect system (it's still evolving)
- ❌ Complete confidence (that comes with reps)

**And That's Okay.**

3-4 episodes in 30 days = **you're on track for 50-60 episodes in a year.**

That's incredible. That's a full podcast series. Be proud.

---

## LONG-TERM MOTIVATION

### Celebrating Everything

**Celebrate:**
- Every episode recorded (seriously, celebrate)
- Every milestone (5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100)
- Every skill improvement
- Every problem solved
- Every week of consistency

**How to Celebrate:**
- Treat yourself (food, activity, purchase)
- Share on social media
- Tell friends/family
- Update your tracker and SEE the progress
- Take a guilt-free rest day

**Why This Matters:**

ADHD brains are reward-deficient. External rewards help compensate.

Don't wait until episode 100 to celebrate. Celebrate episode 1. And 2. And 3.

### Visual Progress

**Create a Visual Tracker:**
- Print a 10x10 grid (100 squares)
- Color one square per completed episode
- Put it somewhere visible
- Watch it fill up

**Digital Options:**
- Notion database with progress bar
- Spreadsheet with conditional formatting
- Habit tracking app
- Social media accountability posts

**Why This Works:**

Seeing progress = dopamine = motivation to continue.

### Community

**Options:**
- Podcasting Discord servers
- Reddit r/podcasting
- Local podcasting meetups
- Virtual co-working sessions
- Accountability partners

**What Community Provides:**
- Accountability
- Encouragement
- Problem-solving help
- Social rewards for progress
- Reduced isolation

### Remembering the Goal

**Why Are You Doing This?**

Write your answer. Revisit it monthly.

**Possible Reasons:**
- Share knowledge you're passionate about
- Build a creative legacy
- Develop a new skill
- Create something meaningful
- Prove you can finish something big
- Help others think critically

**When motivation fades, re-read your "why."**

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### When Everything Feels Impossible

**STOP.**

Take a breath.

**You have options:**

**Option 1: Micro-Task**
- Do just ONE 5-minute task
- Read one episode brief
- Update one tracker
- That's enough for today

**Option 2: Complete Rest**
- Take a week off
- No guilt
- No podcast work
- Rest and reset

**Option 3: Change Something**
- Different episode
- Different approach
- Different time of day
- Different environment

**Option 4: Get Help**
- Ask for accountability
- Join a community
- Hire an editor (if budget allows)
- Find a co-host

### When You Want to Quit

**You Will Want to Quit.**

Around episode 15. Around episode 40. Around episode 75.

**That's normal.**

**When it happens:**

1. **Don't decide immediately.** Give it a week.

2. **Review what you've done.** Listen to your episodes. See your progress.

3. **Lower the bar.** Maybe 100 episodes becomes 50. Maybe 2/week becomes 1/month. Adjust, don't quit.

4. **Remember why you started.** Re-read your goals.

5. **Take a break.** Sometimes you need rest, not quitting.

**You've come too far to stop now.**

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

### This Is Not a Sprint

100 episodes at 1/week = 2 years.

100 episodes at 2/week = 1 year.

**Both are incredible achievements.**

This is a marathon. Pace yourself.

### You Will Improve

Episode 1 will be rough.
Episode 10 will be better.
Episode 50 will be great.
Episode 100 will be legendary.

**Growth is guaranteed if you keep going.**

### You Can Do This

ADHD makes this harder. But ADHD also gives you:
- Hyperfocus superpowers
- Creative connections others miss
- Passion and enthusiasm
- Unique perspectives

**Use your strengths. Accommodate your challenges. Keep going.**

### Start Now

Stop reading. Go to `01-LEARNING-PHASE/week-01-basics.md`.

Or go to `06-QUICK-WINS/easiest-episodes-first.md`.

Or go to `03-EPISODES/` and pick ONE episode.

**Just start.**

The truth is out there. Go find it.

**I Want To Believe you can do this. Now go prove it.**
