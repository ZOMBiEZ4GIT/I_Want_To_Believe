## WEEKLY RHYTHM

---

## TIME-SAVING TIPS

**Batch Prep:**
- Read 3 episode briefs at once
- Mark up multiple recording notes in one session
- Prep your whole week on Monday

**Batch Record:**
- Record 2 cold opens back-to-back
- Record similar sections together
- Stay in "recording mode"

**Batch Edit:**
- Edit 2-3 episodes in one longer session
- Apply same processing to multiple files
- Get into editing flow state

**BUT: Don't batch to the point of burnout.**

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Recording sounds bad:**
- Check mic placement
- Reduce background noise
- Adjust input levels
- Try different time of day

**Can't focus:**
- Take a break
- Try different section
- Reschedule for different day
- Do 5-minute task instead

**Editing taking forever:**
- Set timer (max 2-3 hours)
- Stop when timer goes off
- Done > perfect
- Can always re-master later

**Lost motivation:**
- Review completed episodes
- Check XP and level
- Read your "why"
- Take a guilt-free break

**SAVE THIS WORKFLOW. USE IT EVERY TIME. ADJUST AS NEEDED.**
