## Recording Session Workflow

### Pre-Recording Checklist

- [ ] Read episode framework thoroughly (30-45 min)
- [ ] Highlight dramatic beats and moments to emphasize
- [ ] Mark rant opportunities where you can go off-script
- [ ] Note any difficult pronunciations or technical terms
- [ ] Identify quotes that need character voices
- [ ] Hydrate well (start day before - water, not dairy)
- [ ] Vocal warm-up (10 minutes - see section below)
- [ ] Set up recording environment (close windows, turn off AC/fans temporarily)
- [ ] Test audio levels with enthusiastic speaking
- [ ] Record 30 seconds of room tone (silence - for editing)
- [ ] Have water at room temperature nearby
- [ ] Put phone on airplane mode

### Recording Settings

**Format:** WAV, 44.1kHz, 24-bit
- WAV is uncompressed (maximum quality for editing)
- 44.1kHz is CD quality (perfect for podcasts)
- 24-bit gives you more dynamic range than 16-bit

**Recording Levels:**
- Speak at normal-to-loud volume
- Peak levels should hit -12 to -6 dB
- NEVER go above 0 dB (that's clipping/distortion)
- Test with a hearty laugh - if that doesn't clip, you're good
- Better to record slightly quieter and boost in post than clip

**Microphone Position:**
- 6-8 inches from your mouth
- Slightly off-axis (not directly in front - reduces plosives)
- Pop filter 1-2 inches from microphone
- Consistent position throughout recording (mark your spot)

### Room Setup

**Quick Wins:**
- Record in smallest practical room (less reverb)
- Closets with clothes = excellent natural absorption
- Sit facing away from hard walls if possible
- Heavy curtains, blankets, or moving blankets on reflective surfaces
- Bookshelf behind you = natural diffusion
- Turn off AC, fans, refrigerator if possible during takes

### Recording the Episode

**Suggested Order:**

**1. Record Room Tone First (30 seconds of silence)**
- Sit in position, don't move, don't breathe heavily
- This "silence" has your room's ambient sound
- You'll use this to smooth edits later

**2. Intro (2-3 minutes) - Record LAST**
- Why last? You'll be warmed up and know the episode's energy
- Your intro sets the tone - record it when you're feeling it
- Takes needed: 2-3 full takes, pick the best

**3. Believer's Case (24-26 minutes) - Record in Sections**
- Break into 5-8 minute chunks
- Natural stopping points in the framework
- Take 2-minute break between chunks (sip water, stand, stretch)
- Don't worry about minor mistakes - keep energy up
- Mark major mistakes (clap or say "pickup") and re-record that section
- **Energy level: Medium-high, enthusiastic belief**

**4. Brief Break (5-10 minutes)**
- Walk around, shake out tension
- Vocal exercises (humming, lip trills)
- Hydrate
- Review notes for skeptic section

**5. Skeptic's Response (21-23 minutes) - Record in Sections**
- Shift your mental gear - you're playing devil's advocate now
- Still respectful but more analytical
- Break into 5-8 minute chunks with breaks
- **Energy level: Medium, thoughtful, measured**

**6. Your Take (7-9 minutes) - Record in One or Two Takes**
- This should feel most natural/conversational
- Less scripted, more you
- Okay to ramble a bit and edit down later
- **Energy level: Conversational, authentic**

**7. Outro (2 minutes) - Record in One Take**
- Should be consistent across episodes
- Brief episode recap, next episode tease
- Call to action (subscribe, rate, etc.)

**8. Cold Open (2-3 minutes) - OPTION 1: Record First when fresh, OPTION 2: Record Last when you know the episode's vibe**
- This is your hook - needs highest energy
- Pull the most dramatic moment from the episode
- 2-4 takes until it feels gripping
- **Energy level: HIGH - this sells the episode**

### Dealing with Mistakes

**STOP and re-record when:**
- Major flub (completely wrong info)
- Lose your place entirely
- Coughing fit, sneeze, loud external noise
- Voice cracks or goes weird

**KEEP GOING when:**
- Minor um or ah (you'll edit these)
- Slight mispronunciation you can fix quickly
- Small stumble but you recover
- The energy is good even if not perfect

**The "pickup" technique:**
- Don't stop recording when you make a mistake
- Pause 2 seconds
- Clap once (creates visible spike in waveform)
- Go back to start of sentence and redo it
- Continue forward
- In editing, you'll see the clap spike and know there's a pickup

### Session Length Reality Check

**For 60-minute episode, expect to record:**
- 75-90 minutes of actual audio
- This includes pickups, mistakes, natural variation
- Plus breaks: total session time 2-3 hours

**Can you split it up?**
- YES! Many podcasters do 2-3 sessions
- Session 1: Believer section
- Session 2: Skeptic section + Your Take
- Session 3: Intro, Outro, Cold Open
- Consistency tip: Same time of day = more consistent voice

---

## Vocal Warm-Up Routine (10 minutes)

**Do this BEFORE every recording session**

**Minutes 1-2: Physical Warm-up**
- Roll shoulders backward 10 times
- Roll neck gently (no cracking)
- Stretch arms overhead
- Loosen jaw (open wide, move side to side)
- Facial massage (massage cheeks, jaw, temples)

**Minutes 3-4: Breathing Exercises**
- Breathe in for 4 counts (into belly, not chest)
- Hold for 4 counts
- Breathe out for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Repeat 5 times
- This engages your diaphragm for powerful, supported speech

**Minutes 5-6: Lip Trills and Sirens**
- Lip trills: Blow air through closed lips (like a motorboat sound) for 30 seconds
- Sirens: Say "oooh" and go from lowest comfortable note to highest and back down
- Do 5 siren cycles
- This warms up vocal cords gently

**Minutes 7-8: Tongue Twisters**
- "The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips" (10 times, gradually faster)
- "Red leather, yellow leather" (5 times)
- "Unique New York" (10 times)
- These prepare articulation muscles

**Minutes 9-10: Actual Script Practice**
- Read first paragraph of your episode at half-speed
- Focus on clarity and enunciation
- Then read at normal speed
- Then read with intended energy/emotion

**The Smile Test:**
- Practice a few sentences while smiling
- The smile changes your vocal tone - sounds warmer
- You can hear it in the recording

## Music & Sound Design Strategy

### Understanding Podcast Music Licensing

**CRITICAL: Copyright Matters**
- You CANNOT use commercial music without licensing (not even 10 seconds)
- A single well-known song can cost $1,500-$10,000 to license
- Streaming platforms WILL detect copyrighted music and may remove your episode
- 2025 has seen major crackdowns on unlicensed podcast music

**Your Options:**

**Option 1: Royalty-Free Music Services (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Epidemic Sound**: $15/month (personal), $49/month (commercial)
  - 50,000 tracks, 200,000 sound effects
  - Excellent search by mood/genre
  - License covers podcasts, social media
  - Best for: Serious podcasters wanting variety

- **Artlist**: $199/year (music), $299/year (music + SFX)
  - 18,000 tracks, 11,000 sound effects
  - High-quality cinematic music
  - Annual billing only
  - Best for: Those wanting premium quality

- **Soundstripe**: $19.99/month
  - Growing library
  - Simple licensing
  - Good middle ground

**Option 2: Free Sources**
- **Free Music Archive** (freemusicarchive.org)
  - Creative Commons licensed
  - Curated by genre
  - Check license terms per track (some require attribution)

- **YouTube Audio Library**
  - 1,500+ tracks
  - Free for use beyond YouTube too
  - Easy search by mood/genre

- **Pixabay Music**
  - 1.5 million tracks
  - Completely free, no attribution required
  - Quality varies

**Option 3: Commission Original Music**
- Fiverr: $50-$500 for original theme
- Local musicians: $200-$1000
- You own it forever (get this in writing)
- Most professional option

### Music Strategy for "I Want to Believe"

**Theme Music Recommendations:**
- Style: Mysterious, slightly ominous, building tension
- Think: X-Files vibes, sci-fi investigation
- Should have a memorable hook
- 30-45 second full version
- 10-second "sting" version for transitions

**Where to Search (Epidemic Sound keywords):**
- "Mysterious documentary"
- "Investigation suspense"
- "Sci-fi mystery"
- "Paranormal ambient"

### Episode Music Map

**Cold Open (0:00-0:20)**
- Start with SILENCE or very subtle ambience
- Let your voice carry the drama
- Music swells at the cliffhanger moment (last 5 seconds)
- Cut to intro music

**Intro (0:20-2:30)**
- Full theme song: 0:20-0:50 (30 seconds)
- Fade music to -20dB under your voice for episode introduction
- Music out by 2:30

**Believer Section (2:30-28:00)**
- MOSTLY no music (voice is star)
- Music ONLY at key moments:
  - Major plot point revelation: 3-5 second sting, then out
  - Particularly dramatic testimony: Low ambient bed at -30dB
  - End of section cliffhanger: 5-second build
- **Rule: Music never stays longer than 15 seconds**
- **Rule: Music never louder than -20dB when voice is present**

**Transition (28:00-28:30)**
- Musical cue that signals shift in perspective
- Different feel than intro (maybe more thoughtful, less mysterious)
- Establishes we're changing gears

**Skeptic Section (28:30-50:00)**
- Even LESS music than Believer section
- Maybe one subtle cue when introducing major counterargument
- Let the analysis breathe

**Transition to Your Take (50:00-50:15)**
- Brief music cue
- Signals "now here's what I really think"
- Can be more personal/intimate sound

**Your Take (50:15-58:00)**
- Light ambient bed possible at -30dB if it enhances mood
- Or completely dry - your authentic voice

**Outro (58:00-60:00)**
- Theme music returns (maybe different arrangement)
- 58:00-58:30: Under your voice at -20dB
- 58:30-60:00: Full theme with credits/next episode tease

### Sound Effects - Use Sparingly!

**When to use:**
- Specific sound relevant to story (UFO humming, Bigfoot call) - BRIEF
- Transition stings between sections
- Cold open dramatic moment

**When NOT to use:**
- Don't overdo it - this is a talking podcast, not a radio drama
- Avoid cheesy effects
- Never use effects that distract from content

**Good free sources:**
- Freesound.org
- BBC Sound Effects Library (free for non-commercial)
- Epidemic Sound (if subscribed)

### The Golden Rules of Podcast Music

1. **Voice is ALWAYS primary** - Music supports, never competes
2. **When in doubt, use less** - Silence is powerful
3. **Consistency matters** - Same intro/outro music every episode
4. **Fade gradually** - Sudden cuts are jarring (1-2 second fades)
5. **Check on phone speakers** - Most listeners use phones, not studio monitors

---

## Editing Workflow

### Overview

Editing takes 4-6 hours for a 60-minute episode (assuming you recorded 75-90 minutes of audio). This will decrease as you get faster, but don't rush - quality matters.

### Pass 1: Structural Edit (2-3 hours)

**Goal: Get from 90 minutes of recording to ~63 minutes of rough structure**

**Process:**
1. Import all audio files into DAW
2. Arrange in order (Cold Open, Intro, Believer, Skeptic, Your Take, Outro)
3. **Remove obvious mistakes:**
   - Pickups (find clap spike, delete bad take, keep good one)
   - Long pauses (more than 2 seconds)
   - Off-topic tangents
   - Coughs, mouth sounds, re-starts

4. **Don't worry about yet:**
   - Small ums and ahs (next pass)
   - Final music placement (just rough)
   - Audio processing (later)

5. **Listen at 1.5x speed** for this pass
   - Helps you hear mistakes without getting bored
   - You'll catch pacing issues

6. **Use markers/colors:**
   - Mark spots that need music
   - Mark awkward transitions
   - Mark sections to possibly trim more

**Result: Rough 63-minute episode**

### Pass 2: Fine Edit (1-2 hours)

**Goal: Polish to final content and timing**

**Process:**
1. **Listen at normal speed** (can't rush this part)
2. **Remove excessive filler words:**
   - Every "um" and "ah"? NO - sounds robotic
   - Ones that disrupt flow? YES
   - Rule: If it bothers you, it'll bother listeners

3. **Tighten pacing:**
   - Trim pauses between sentences to 0.5-1 second
   - But keep natural breathing room
   - Remove false starts mid-sentence

4. **Smooth transitions:**
   - Between sections should feel intentional
   - Add room tone if cuts feel abrupt (2-3 seconds)

5. **Add music and effects:**
   - Import music tracks
   - Place at marked spots
   - Set levels (music at -20dB under voice, -6dB for full theme)
   - Add fade-ins/outs (1-2 seconds)

6. **Check timing:**
   - Aim for 58-62 minutes total
   - Too long? Look for repetitive sections
   - Too short? Let moments breathe more

**Result: Content-locked episode ready for audio processing**

### Pass 3: Audio Processing (30-60 minutes)

**Goal: Make it sound professional and consistent**

**Order of processing:**

**1. Noise Reduction (if needed)**
- Use built-in noise reduction tool
- Select room tone sample as "noise profile"
- Apply gently (aggressive = robotic voice)
- Only reduce 6-12dB of noise, not eliminate entirely

**2. EQ (Equalization)**
- **High-pass filter at 80-100 Hz**: Removes rumble, HVAC, handling noise
- **Gentle boost at 3-5 kHz (+2 to +4 dB)**: Adds presence and clarity to voice
- **Gentle cut around 200-400 Hz (-2 dB)**: Reduces muddiness if needed
- **Don't boost more than 6dB anywhere** - sounds unnatural

**Audacity EQ Preset:**
```
Filter Curve: Use "Graphic EQ"
80 Hz: -40dB (high-pass filter)
200 Hz: -2dB
1000 Hz: 0dB
3000 Hz: +3dB
8000 Hz: +1dB
```

**3. Compression**
- **Threshold: -20dB**
- **Ratio: 3:1 or 4:1**
- **Attack: 10ms**
- **Release: 100ms**
- **Makeup Gain: 2-4dB**

What this does: Makes quiet parts louder and loud parts quieter = consistent volume

**Audacity:** Effect > Compressor
**Adobe Audition:** Effects Rack > Dynamics > Multiband Compressor (Podcast Voice preset)

**4. De-essing (if needed)**
- Only if "S" sounds are harsh
- Target frequency: 6000-8000 Hz
- Gentle reduction (3-6dB)
- A little goes a long way

**5. Limiter (final safety)**
- Ceiling: -1dB (prevents any clipping)
- This catches any peaks that got through

**6. Loudness Normalization**
- **Target: -16 LUFS** (Apple Podcasts standard)
- Spotify recommends -14 LUFS, but -16 works everywhere
- True-peak should not exceed -1dB

**Audacity:** Effect > Loudness Normalization > Set to -16 LUFS
**Adobe Audition:** Effects > Match Loudness > ITU-R BS.1770-3 > -16 LUFS

### Pass 4: Quality Control (30-60 minutes)

**Critical step - don't skip!**

1. **Listen to entire episode at normal speed**
   - Pretend you're a listener
   - Take notes on anything off

2. **Check these specifically:**
   - [ ] No clipping or distortion
   - [ ] Consistent volume throughout
   - [ ] Music doesn't overpower voice
   - [ ] Transitions feel smooth
   - [ ] No awkward silences
   - [ ] Pacing feels good (not too rushed or dragging)
   - [ ] The emotional beats land

3. **Listen on different devices:**
   - Your studio headphones (you already did this)
   - **Phone speaker** (how most people listen!) - CRITICAL
   - Car speakers if possible
   - Earbuds

4. **Ask these questions:**
   - Would I listen to this?
   - Does it grab me in the first 30 seconds?
   - Are there spots I'd skip? (Edit them)
   - Is my passion for the topic coming through?

### Export Settings

**Final Export:**
- **Format: MP3**
- **Bitrate: 128kbps stereo** OR **96kbps mono** (if solo voice only)
- **Sample rate: 44.1kHz**
- **Quality: High/Constant bitrate**

**Why MP3?** Universal compatibility, reasonable file size (60 min ≈ 55MB at 128kbps)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Over-editing**
- Removing every um/ah makes you sound like a robot
- Leave some natural speech patterns
- Authenticity > perfection

**2. Under-editing**
- Long pauses kill momentum
- Obvious mistakes break immersion
- Find the balance

**3. Music too loud**
- #1 beginner mistake
- Voice should always be clearly heard
- When in doubt, music should be quieter

**4. Inconsistent levels between episodes**
- Listener shouldn't need to adjust volume between episodes
- Stick to -16 LUFS for every episode

**5. Recording in untreated room**
- Echo and reverb scream "amateur"
- Even basic treatment (blankets, closet) makes huge difference

**6. Not monitoring with headphones**
- You won't hear issues in real-time
- Background noise, plosives, mouth sounds

**7. Ignoring room tone**
- Edits will sound choppy without room tone to fill gaps

**8. Compression abuse**
- Too much compression sounds unnatural and fatiguing
- Gentle compression (3:1 or 4:1 ratio) is plenty

**9. Not backing up**
- Hard drives fail
- Cloud backup: Google Drive, Dropbox, Backblaze
- Keep raw recordings until episode is published

**10. Perfectionism paralysis**
- Done is better than perfect
- You'll improve with each episode
- Don't let episode 1 take 6 months

**11. Forgetting vocal warm-ups**
- Cold voice = more takes = longer session = vocal fatigue

**12. Not staying hydrated**
- Mouth clicks and dry voice are avoidable
- Room temperature water (cold tightens vocal cords)

## Voice Performance Tips for Solo Podcasting

### The Challenge of Solo Shows

You're talking to yourself in an empty room. It's weird. Here's how to make it not weird:

**1. Imagine ONE person**
- Don't imagine "an audience"
- Picture one specific friend who'd love this topic
- Talk to them

**2. Record standing (at least sometimes)**
- Standing = more energy in voice
- More breath support
- Hand gestures come naturally
- Try it for cold open and dramatic moments

**3. Use hand gestures even though nobody sees**
- Your voice reflects your body language
- Gesturing makes you more animated
- Seriously, it works

**4. Smile during lighter moments**
- Listeners can hear a smile in your voice
- Changes resonance and warmth
- Especially important for humor

**5. Vary your delivery**
- **Pace:** Speed up for excitement, slow down for gravity
- **Volume:** Louder for emphasis, quieter for intimacy
- **Pitch:** Don't be monotone
- **Pauses:** Strategic silence is powerful

### Maintaining Energy for 60 Minutes

**The 20-minute rule:**
- Take a 5-minute break every 20 minutes
- Stand, stretch, walk around
- Vocal exercises (humming, lip trills)
- Hydrate

**Save your best energy for:**
- Cold open (first thing you record OR last)
- Dramatic story beats
- Your personal take at the end

**It's okay if middle sections are lower energy:**
- You'll edit out low-energy bits
- Better to do multiple takes than push through fatigue

**When to stop and resume later:**
- Voice feels strained or hoarse
- You've been recording 90+ minutes
- Energy is flagging and takes aren't good
- Better to split session than force it

### Character Voices for Quotes

**For "I Want to Believe":**
- You'll be reading witness testimonies, expert quotes, debunker statements
- Small vocal variations help listeners track who's talking

**Don't go overboard:**
- Not looking for impressions
- Just slight shifts in tone/energy
- "Witness voice" might be breathless, excited
- "Skeptic voice" might be more measured, clinical
- "Government official voice" might be formal, evasive

**Practice technique:**
- Read quote
- Ask "How would this person FEEL saying this?"
- Let that emotion color your voice
- Don't do accents unless you're good at them

### Managing Vocal Fatigue

**Prevention:**
- Hydrate day before recording
- No dairy before recording (creates phlegm)
- No alcohol night before (dehydrates)
- Warm up properly
- Take breaks

**If voice gets tired:**
- STOP recording immediately
- Warm water with honey
- Gentle humming (don't strain)
- Rest voice for 30-60 minutes
- If still tired, resume tomorrow

**Red flags - see a doctor:**
- Persistent hoarseness (more than 2 weeks)
- Pain when speaking
- Losing voice regularly

**For 60-minute episodes:**
- Consider this your workout
- You're building vocal stamina
- Gets easier over time
- Professionals can do hours, but takes practice
