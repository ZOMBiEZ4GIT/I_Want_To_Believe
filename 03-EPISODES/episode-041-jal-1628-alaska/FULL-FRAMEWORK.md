## 🎯 COLD OPEN

**THE MOMENT:**
November 17, 1986. **5:09 PM local time.** Alaskan airspace.

**Japan Airlines Flight 1628:**
- **Aircraft:** Boeing 747 cargo freighter
- **Crew:** 3 (Captain Kenju Terauchi, Copilot Takanori Tamefuji, Flight Engineer Yoshio Tsukuba)
- **Route:** Paris → Anchorage → Tokyo
- **Cargo:** Beaujolais wine (bottles)
- **Altitude:** 35,000 feet
- **Weather:** Clear, dark (early winter evening)

**Captain Kenju Terauchi** (47 years old, 29 years flying experience, **ex-Japan Air Self-Defense Force fighter pilot**, ~10,000 flight hours, senior JAL pilot, excellent safety record):

**5:09 PM (Alaska time, near Fort Yukon, 35,000 feet):** Notices **two small lights** ahead and below. **White/yellow glow.**

**Thinks:** "Traffic" (another aircraft).

**Lights move CLOSER.** Not typical aircraft pattern.

**5:11 PM:** **Lights shift position.** Now **directly in front** of 747. **Pacing aircraft.**

**Terauchi:** "Do you see that?"

**Copilot Tamefuji:** "Yes. What is it?"

**Lights INTENSIFY.** Brighter. Warmer (cabin temperature rises noticeably).

**Terauchi's description:**
"They were flying in formation. One on each side. Then they moved—directly in front. The cockpit became WARM. Like we were facing exhaust or energy."

---

**5:18 PM:** The lights **TRANSFORM.**

**Two small lights become:**
**TWO LARGE OBJECTS.**

**Shape:** Rectangular/square (like "Christmas cake," Terauchi later said).

**Details visible:**
- **Lights arranged in grids** (multiple ports/windows?)
- **Glowing nozzles** (emitting fire/energy)
- **Metallic structure** (edges defined)

**Size:** Estimates vary (Terauchi: "Four times size of 747")

**Distance:** ~500-1,000 feet ahead

**Behavior:** **Hovering in formation** with JAL 1628 (matching speed: ~500 mph at 35,000 feet)

**Terauchi (to Anchorage ATC):** "We have traffic. Unidentified. Request vectors."

**ATC:** "No traffic on radar in your vicinity."

**Terauchi:** "Visual confirmed. Two large objects. Directly ahead."

---

**5:25 PM:** Objects **vanish.**

**Crew relieved.** Resume normal flight.

**5:26 PM:** **Terauchi sees something behind aircraft.**

**Looks over shoulder (through cockpit window):**

**MASSIVE SILHOUETTE.**

**"Like a giant walnut."** Terauchi's exact words.

**Size:** "As big as two aircraft carriers."

**Distance:** Following 747, ~7-8 miles behind (visible as dark mass against darkening sky).

**Terauchi to ATC:** "We have... something very large behind us."

**ATC:** "We're checking radar."

**FAA Ground Radar (Anchorage):** Initially found nothing, then **confirms unknown target** behind JAL 1628.

**Military Radar (Elmendorf ROCC—Regional Operations Control Center):** Reports **"surge primary return"** after some minutes. Advises **"primary radar return in 10 o'clock position at 8 miles."** Later: **"Intermittent primary target behind in trail."**

---

**5:30-5:39 PM:** **Evasive maneuvers.**

**ATC (to Terauchi):** "Descend to 31,000 feet. Turn heading 270."

**Terauchi complies.** Object follows.

**ATC:** "Descend to 25,000 feet. Turn heading 215."

**Object continues following.**

**Terauchi requests:** "Can we have United Airlines flight in area check our six?"

**ATC contacts United 69 (nearby):** "Can you confirm visual on traffic behind JAL?"

**United 69:** "We see JAL. No traffic behind them." (But by this time, object had disappeared from JAL crew's view)

**5:39 PM:** Object **vanishes** from radar and visual.

**Total duration:** **~30 minutes.**

---

**AFTERMATH:**

**FAA Investigation:** Launched immediately. Radar data reviewed. Crew interviewed **separately** (discrepancies found). **3-month investigation.**

**March 5, 1987:** **FAA press conference** releases results.
- **Conclusion:** "Uncorrelated primary and beacon target" (only control tower radar, no other systems)
- **FAA statement:** "Did **not have enough material to confirm that something was there**" (but accepted crew descriptions)

**Media:** Story leaks (December 1986). International headlines. **Kyodo News** journalists interview Terauchi.

**Captain Terauchi:** Grounded. Career destroyed. JAL reassigns him to desk job. Eventually retires early.

**FAA Revelation:** Terauchi classified as **"UFO repeater"**—two prior UFO sightings + **two more in January 1987** (including **January 11, 1987 same general area** as Flight 1628).

**1988:** Crew interviewed separately again—**remembrances differed significantly.** Terauchi **contradicted** what he told flight controllers at time of incident.

**FAA Division Chief John Callahan:** Later reveals (2001): **CIA held secret meeting** with FAA officials. Reviewed JAL 1628 data. **Conclusion: "This event never happened. Do not discuss."**

**John Callahan Background:**
- **Position:** Division Chief, Accidents and Investigations Branch, FAA (Washington DC)
- **Service:** 6 years (July 1985 - after beginning of 1987, covered JAL 1628 incident)
- **The meeting (held day after incident):** FAA Administrator **Admiral Engen** convened
  - **Attendees:** FBI, CIA, **President Reagan's Scientific Study Team**, FAA officials
  - **Presented:** Videotape radar evidence, voice communications tapes, paper reports
  - **CIA statement:** "The meeting never took place," "this incident was never recorded"
- **Callahan's actions:** Kept **copies/originals**: Primary radar printouts, video tape of first analysis, pilots report, first FAA report, first-generation voice communications tapes
- **2001:** **Blew whistle** with paper records, video tapes, voice tapes to back claims

**Believers:** Extraordinary encounter. Radar confirmation = proof. Government cover-up.

**Skeptics:** Misidentified military aircraft, Jupiter (planet), or st

ratoliner reflection. Pilot imagination. Radar artifact.

**Same flight. Same 30 minutes. Two completely different stories.**

## 📖 OVERVIEW

**JAL Flight 1628 Incident:**
- November 17, 1986, Alaskan airspace
- Boeing 747 cargo flight (crew of 3)
- Two small objects → two large objects → massive "mothership"
- Duration: ~30 minutes
- Visual (all three crew) + radar confirmation (FAA + military)
- FAA investigation → CIA involvement → pilot's career ended

**Believer position:** Multiple witnesses (trained pilots), radar confirmation (independent verification), evasive maneuvers (not hallucination), government cover-up (CIA meeting suppressed), pilot punished for truth

**Skeptic position:** Misidentified Jupiter + military jets refueling, radar = false positive (temperature inversion), pilot's story evolved/exaggerated, no physical evidence, CIA meeting = routine briefing

**Reality:** **Something appeared on radar and was visually seen.** WHAT it was = disputed.

## 👽 BELIEVER'S CASE (25 min)

### THE WITNESSES (CREDIBLE & TRAINED)

**Captain Kenju Terauchi:**
- **Age:** 47
- **Experience:** 29 years flying, ~10,000 hours
- **Background:** Ex-Japan Air Self-Defense Force fighter pilot (military training)
- **Reputation:** Senior JAL pilot, excellent safety record
- **December 1986:** Interviewed by Kyodo News journalists

**First Officer Takanori Tamefuji:**
- Experienced commercial pilot
- Corroborated Terauchi's sighting (saw objects)
- **1988:** When interviewed separately, remembrance **differed** from Terauchi's

**Flight Engineer Yoshio Tsukuba:**
- Also saw objects
- Less detailed account (focused on instruments), but confirmed presence
- **1988:** Separately interviewed, account **less certain** than Terauchi's

**Believer Point:**
"Three trained observers. All saw same thing. Not amateurs."

**Skeptic Counter (1988 re-interviews):**
"Crew's remembrances **differed significantly** when interviewed separately. Terauchi **contradicted** what he told flight controllers at time. Story evolved."

### THE ENCOUNTER (DETAILED TIMELINE)

**Phase 1: Small Lights (5:09-5:18 PM)**

**Initial Sighting:**
- **Two lights** (white/yellow)
- **Ahead and below** aircraft
- **Approached** 747

**Terauchi's Actions:**
1. **Observed** (thought traffic)
2. **Checked instruments** (no malfunction)
3. **Alerted crew**

**Phase 2: Large Objects (5:18-5:25 PM)**

**Transformation:**
- **Lights became structures**
- **Rectangular/square shape**
- **Grid-like light patterns** (dozens of lights arranged)
- **Glowing nozzles** (fire/energy emission—visible)

**Size Estimates:**
- **Terauchi:** "Four times larger than 747"
- **Position:** 500-1,000 feet ahead (close proximity—DANGER if collision)

**Physical Effects:**
- **Cockpit warmed** (noticeable temperature rise—Terauchi removed jacket)
- **Bright light** (illuminated cloud deck below)

**Believer Claim:**
"These weren't distant stars or planets. They were CLOSE. Structures VISIBLE."

**Phase 3: The "Mothership" (5:26-5:39 PM)**

**Appearance:**
- **Behind aircraft** (Terauchi saw via window)
- **Massive silhouette** ("like giant walnut," "two aircraft carriers")
- **Dark mass** (blocked stars)

**Radar Confirmation:**
- **FAA Anchorage:** Tracked object
- **USAF radar:** Also detected
- **Position:** Matched visual sighting (behind JAL 1628)

**Evasive Maneuvers:**
- **ATC directed turns, altitude changes**
- **Object followed** (maintained position behind 747)
- **Duration:** ~13 minutes

**Believer:**
"Radar doesn't lie. FAA AND military confirmed. This was REAL."

### RADAR CONFIRMATION (INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION)

**FAA Ground Radar (Anchorage):**
- **Initially found nothing**
- **Later detected unknown target** behind JAL 1628
- **Position consistent** with Terauchi's report
- **No transponder signal** (not commercial aircraft)
- **March 5, 1987 FAA conclusion:** "Uncorrelated primary and beacon target" (**only control tower radar**, no other systems saw it)

**Elmendorf ROCC (USAF Regional Operations Control Center):**
- **"Surge primary return"** after some minutes
- **Primary radar return:** 10 o'clock position, 8 miles from JAL 1628
- **"Intermittent primary target behind in trail"**
- **Confirmed to FAA**

**John Callahan (FAA Division Chief, Accidents & Investigations):**
- **Position:** 6-year Division Chief (July 1985 - after early 1987)
- **2001 testimony:** "The data showed something was there. Radar doesn't pick up hallucinations."
- **Kept evidence:** Primary radar printouts, video tape, pilots report, first FAA report, voice tapes

**Believer Point:**
"Pilot could hallucinate. Radar can't. Both FAA Anchorage AND military ROCC saw targets = proof."

**Skeptic Counter:**
"FAA concluded **'uncorrelated primary and beacon target'**—only control tower saw it, no other radar systems. Likely radar artifact."

### THE FAA INVESTIGATION

**Immediate Response:**

**November 17-18, 1986:**
- **FAA interviews crew** (separately)
- **Reviews radar tapes** (video + data recordings)
- **Analyzes flight path**

**Findings (Internal):**
- **Crew credible** (no signs of impairment, dishonesty)
- **Radar data confirmed** (unknown target present)
- **No conventional explanation** identified

**Believer:**
"FAA took it SERIOUSLY. That says something."

### THE CIA MEETING (COVER-UP EVIDENCE)

**John Callahan's Revelation (2001 Whistleblower Disclosure):**

**Callahan's Background:**
- **Position:** Division Chief, Accidents and Investigations Branch, FAA (Washington DC)
- **Service:** 6 years (July 1985 - after beginning of 1987)
- **2001:** Came forward, blew whistle with **paper records, video tapes, voice tapes**

**The Meeting (Day After Incident, November 18, 1986):**
- **Convened by:** FAA Administrator **Admiral Engen**
- **Attendees:** FAA officials, CIA, FBI, **President Reagan's Scientific Study Team**
- **Purpose:** Review JAL 1628 data
- **Location:** FAA headquarters, Washington D.C.

**Presented:**
- **Videotape radar evidence** (visual display of JAL 1628 + unknown target)
- **Voice communications tapes** (pilot-ATC audio)
- **Paper reports** (flight data)

**CIA Statement (per Callahan):**
"Gentlemen, **this event never happened.** We were never here. **Do not discuss this with anyone.**"

**Callahan:**
"They confiscated materials. Told us to deny meeting occurred."

**Callahan's Preservation:**
- **Kept copies (some originals):** Primary radar target printouts, video tape of first analysis, pilots report, first FAA report, **first-generation voice communications tapes**
- **2001:** Released evidence to support claims

**Believer Claim:**
"TEXTBOOK cover-up. CIA + **President Reagan's Scientific Study Team** involvement = they KNOW it's real. Callahan risked career, kept evidence, proved meeting happened."

### CAPTAIN TERAUCHI'S PUNISHMENT

**Career Destruction:**

**Immediate:**
- **Grounded by JAL** (indefinitely)
- **Desk job assignment** (no more flying)

**Public Ridicule:**
- **Media coverage:** Some outlets mocked Terauchi
- **JAL embarrassed:** International airline, public UFO claim = bad PR

**Eventual Outcome:**
- **Returned to flight duty** (after months, reduced capacity)
- **Early retirement** (career never fully recovered)

**Believer Interpretation:**
"Punishment for telling truth. Discourages other pilots from reporting."

### WHY BELIEVERS FIND IT COMPELLING

**Argument 1: MULTIPLE LINES OF EVIDENCE**

- **Visual:** Three witnesses
- **Radar:** Two independent systems (FAA + military)
- **Audio:** ATC recordings (pilot-controller conversation)
- **FAA investigation:** Confirmed credibility

**Believer:**
"This isn't just a story. It's DOCUMENTED."

**Argument 2: TRAINED OBSERVERS**

- **Pilots:** Know aircraft, planets, weather phenomena
- **Wouldn't mistake Jupiter** (common skeptic claim)
- **Described structured craft** (not ambiguous lights)

**Argument 3: PHYSICAL EFFECTS**

- **Cockpit warming:** Consistent with energy emission
- **Radar returns:** Physical phenomenon (not psychological)

**Argument 4: GOVERNMENT COVER-UP**

- **CIA meeting:** Suppression of evidence
- **Pilot punished:** Silencing witnesses
- **Pattern:** Consistent with Roswell, Rendlesham, etc.

**Argument 5: NO CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION**

- **FAA couldn't explain**
- **30+ years later, still debated**
- **Believer:** "If it was Jupiter, FAA would've said so."

[BELIEVER RANT: "Three PILOTS. FAA RADAR. Military RADAR. Thirty MINUTES of visual contact. And the CIA shows up, says 'this never happened,' and the pilot's career is DESTROYED. This is PROOF. Radar-confirmed UFO. Government cover-up. And skeptics say 'Jupiter'? Jupiter doesn't follow you for 30 minutes and show up on RADAR!"]

## 🔬 SKEPTIC'S RESPONSE (22 min)

### THE JUPITER + MILITARY JETS THEORY

**Skeptic Explanation (Philip Klass, 1987 Analysis):**

**Philip Klass:**
- **Published:** "FAA Data Sheds New Light on JAL Pilot's UFO Report" (Skeptical Inquirer, Vol 11, Issue 4, pages 322-326, 1987)
- **Conclusion:** Pilot probably mistook **Jupiter (and Mars)** as UFOs

**Phase 1-2 (Small lights → large objects):**
- **Jupiter** (planet, very bright in November 1986 Alaskan sky)
- **Position:** **Only 10 degrees above horizon** (low on southeastern horizon from Alaska—where Terauchi saw objects)
- **Mars** also visible
- **Brightness:** Jupiter magnitude ~-2.0 (very bright); increased perception as eyes adjusted to darkness
- **Movement illusion:** Autokinetic effect (stationary light appears to move when stared at in dark)

**Phase 3 (Mothership):**
- **USAF KC-135 tanker + fighter jets** (mid-air refueling exercise)
- **Common in Alaska** (Elmendorf AFB nearby)
- **Large silhouette:** Tanker aircraft (large plane)
- **Radar contact:** Legitimate military aircraft (Elmendorf ROCC picked up exercise)

**Klass Evidence:**
- **1988 crew re-interviews:** Remembrances **differed significantly** when interviewed separately
- **Terauchi contradicted** what he told flight controllers at time
- **FAA classification:** Terauchi = **"UFO repeater"** (two prior sightings + two more in January 1987, including **January 11, 1987 same general area** as Flight 1628)

**Skeptic Conclusion:**
"Terauchi saw Jupiter/Mars, thought UFO. Then saw military exercise, thought mothership. **UFO repeater** with confirmation bias misidentified planets + aircraft."

### DEBUNKING THE RADAR "CONFIRMATION"

**Radar False Positives:**

**Dr. James Oberg (Aerospace Engineer, Skeptic):**
- **Temperature inversions:** Atmospheric conditions cause radar reflections (false targets)
- **Alaska in November:** Prone to inversions
- **"Target" behind JAL:** Likely atmospheric artifact, not solid object

**No United Airlines Confirmation:**
- **United 69 was nearby:** Looked for JAL's "traffic"
- **Saw nothing:** If massive object present, United would've seen it
- **Skeptic:** Proves object wasn't physical (or didn't exist)

**Military Radar Contact:**
- **Skeptic theory:** Radar detected ACTUAL military jets (refueling exercise), NOT UFO
- **Coincidence:** Military jets in area at same time as JAL sighting

### TERAUCHI'S CREDIBILITY QUESTIONED

**Skeptic Challenges:**

**1. Story Evolution:**
- **Initial report (to flight controllers at time):** Less dramatic
- **December 1986 Kyodo News interview:** More dramatic ("size of aircraft carriers," "walnut shape")
- **1988 re-interview:** **Contradicted** what he told flight controllers
- **Skeptic:** Story grew with retelling (embellishment over time)

**2. "UFO Repeater" (FAA Classification):**
- **Prior sightings:** **Two UFO reports before November 17, 1986**
- **After Flight 1628:** **Two more UFO reports in January 1987**
  - **January 11, 1987:** UFO sighting in **same general area** as Flight 1628 (Alaska)
- **FAA assessment:** **"UFO repeater"**—predisposed to interpret ambiguous stimuli as UFOs (confirmation bias)

**3. Cultural Context:**
- **Japan 1980s:** UFO interest high (popular culture)
- **Terauchi:** May have been influenced by media

**Philip Klass (1987 Analysis):**
"Terauchi is **UFO repeater**. WANTED to see UFO. When he saw Jupiter (10 degrees above horizon), his brain filled in 'alien craft.' Four total UFO reports (two before, two after) = pattern of misidentification."

### THE COPILOT & FLIGHT ENGINEER (LESS CERTAIN)

**Skeptic Point:**

**First Officer Tamefuji:**
- **Saw lights:** But less detailed account than Terauchi
- **Didn't see mothership clearly**
- **1988 re-interview:** Remembrance **differed** from Terauchi's account

**Flight Engineer Tsukuba:**
- **Focused on instruments:** Saw "something," not detailed structure
- **Later:** Less certain than Terauchi
- **1988 re-interview:** Account **less certain** overall

**Skeptic Interpretation:**
"Terauchi's certainty influenced crew. Classic group dynamics—leader's interpretation becomes shared narrative. **1988 separate interviews showed discrepancies**—crew didn't see same details Terauchi claimed."

### THE CIA MEETING = ROUTINE BRIEFING

**Skeptic Alternative:**

**John Callahan's Account:**
- **Believer interpretation:** Cover-up (CIA ordered suppression)
- **Skeptic:** Callahan is **UFO conference speaker** (financial interest—paid appearances on pro-UFO circuit), exaggerated meeting

**Callahan's Background:**
- **FAA Division Chief (Accidents & Investigations):** Legitimate career (6 years, July 1985 - after early 1987)
- **2001:** Blew whistle, frequent UFO conference speaker since
- **Skeptic concern:** Financial interest in UFO narrative (paid speaking engagements)

**Alternative Explanation:**
- **Meeting occurred:** Routine (FAA briefs agencies on unusual incidents, especially with radar data)
- **"This never happened":** Misunderstood instruction (meant "don't leak to media to prevent panic," not "deny reality")
- **CIA + President Reagan's Scientific Study Team presence:** Standard (national security assessment—Cold War, checking for Soviet activity/technology)

**Skeptic:**
"Callahan is selling a narrative on UFO conference circuit. CIA involvement = routine national security briefing, not sinister cover-up. Callahan's financial interest (paid speaking) = bias."

### TERAUCHI'S GROUNDING = STANDARD PROCEDURE

**Skeptic Explanation:**

**Why JAL Grounded Terauchi:**
1. **Public UFO claim:** Embarrassed airline
2. **Psychological eval:** Standard after pilot reports unusual experience (safety protocol)
3. **Media circus:** JAL wanted to de-escalate (grounding = removing pilot from spotlight)

**Not Punishment:**
- **Terauchi returned to flight duty** (eventually)
- **Retired normally** (not fired)

**Skeptic:**
"Grounding = PR management, not conspiracy."

### WHAT WE CAN PROVE

**Facts:**
- JAL 1628 crew reported seeing objects (November 17, 1986) ✓
- FAA/USAF radar detected something ✓
- FAA investigated ✓
- CIA/FAA meeting occurred (per Callahan) ✓
- Terauchi grounded temporarily ✓

**Cannot Prove:**
- Objects were extraterrestrial craft ✗
- Radar detected alien ship (vs. atmospheric/military) ✗
- CIA covered up evidence ✗

[SKEPTICAL RANT: "Jupiter was BRIGHT that night. It was LOW on the horizon—exactly where Terauchi saw 'objects.' And the mothership? Military tanker refueling jets. Alaska is FULL of military exercises! Radar picked up those jets, NOT an alien ship. Terauchi MIS-IDENTIFIED. He's a UFO believer—admitted it! Of COURSE he saw UFOs. Confirmation bias!"]

---

## 💭 MY TAKE (8 min)

### WHAT I WANT TO BELIEVE
- That a massive alien mothership followed a 747 for 30 minutes
- That radar proved its existence beyond doubt
- That the CIA covered it up to prevent panic
- That Captain Terauchi was punished for exposing the truth

### WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK
- **50% misidentified Jupiter + military aircraft, 30% atmospheric/radar phenomenon, 20% unknown**
- Leaning misidentification because:
  - **Jupiter WAS bright/visible** (confirmed by astronomy data)
  - **Military exercises common in Alaska** (tanker = "mothership" silhouette plausible)
  - **United 69 saw nothing** (if object massive, they'd have seen it)
  - **Terauchi's story evolved** (grew more dramatic over time)
- But not 100% certain because:
  - **Radar confirmation hard to dismiss** (two systems)
  - **Three witnesses** (not just Terauchi)
  - **FAA took it seriously** (not just dismissed)
  - **30 minutes** (long duration—harder to sustain misidentification)

**Position:** Probably misidentified Jupiter + military jets, but admits radar data complicates skeptical explanation

### THE BIGGER PICTURE

**Why JAL 1628 Matters:**

1. **Radar + Visual = Gold Standard:**
   - **Believers:** "This is THE case—radar proves it!"
   - **Skeptics:** "Radar can be fooled—false positives happen"
   - **Reality:** Radar confirmation ELEVATES case, doesn't PROVE aliens

2. **The Pilot's Dilemma:**
   - **Terauchi reported honestly** (what he believed he saw)
   - **Career destroyed** (temporarily, but damaged)
   - **Lesson:** Pilots STILL reluctant to report UFOs (fear of ridicule/consequences)
   - **Result:** Data suppressed (how many pilots see things, stay silent?)

3. **The CIA Meeting Mystery:**
   - **Callahan's story:** IF true, troubling (government suppression)
   - **But:** Single source (Callahan), no documents leaked
   - **Skeptics:** Exaggerated/misremembered
   - **Believers:** Textbook cover-up
   - **Truth:** Probably somewhere between (meeting happened, significance disputed)

4. **Jupiter: The UFO Explanation Workhorse:**
   - **Skeptics overuse Jupiter** (like skeptics overuse Venus)
   - **But:** Jupiter IS bright, DOES appear to move (autokinetic effect real)
   - **Problem:** Pilots trained to recognize planets (would Terauchi really mistake Jupiter?)
   - **Counter:** Even experts can misidentify under certain conditions (fatigue, darkness, expectation)

5. **The "No Explanation" Problem:**
   - **FAA didn't conclude "Jupiter"** (officially unexplained)
   - **Believers:** "See? They couldn't explain it!"
   - **Skeptics:** "Unexplained ≠ aliens. Just means insufficient data."
   - **Reality:** Some cases WILL remain ambiguous (data incomplete, witnesses fallible)

**What I Learned:**
JAL 1628 is frustrating because it ALMOST has everything believers want: credible witnesses, radar, official investigation. But it's ALSO frustratingly ambiguous: Jupiter was there, military jets were there, United saw nothing, Terauchi's story evolved. It's the PERFECT case study in how UFO evidence is never quite enough—for EITHER side. And that's either because aliens are elusive... or because they're not there.

**Closing Thought:**
If I were Captain Terauchi, I'd believe I saw a UFO too. The experience was clearly profound for him. But subjective certainty ≠ objective truth. I think he saw SOMETHING—most likely Jupiter morphing into military jets in his perception. But I can't prove it. And that's the problem. JAL 1628 will be debated forever because the data is GOOD ENOUGH to keep believers believing, and AMBIGUOUS ENOUGH to keep skeptics skeptical. And maybe that's all UFO evidence ever is.

- **Believer defense:** "Risked reputation, kept evidence for 15 years, proved meeting happened"

**The Jupiter Position (November 17, 1986):**
- **Jupiter visible:** Low on horizon (southeastern sky from Alaska)
- **Position:** **Only 10 degrees above horizon** (per Klass 1987 analysis)
- **Mars:** Also visible
- **Brightness:** Jupiter magnitude ~-2.0 (very bright, second only to Venus among planets)
- **Skeptic (Klass):** "Perfect conditions for misidentification—low horizon, very bright, autokinetic effect"
- **Believer:** "Trained ex-fighter pilot with 10,000 hours wouldn't mistake planet. Terauchi knows what Jupiter looks like."
- **Skeptic counter:** "Terauchi = **'UFO repeater'** (FAA)—four total UFO reports (two before, two after). Predisposed to misidentify."

**United Airlines 69:**
- **Asked by ATC:** Check for traffic behind JAL
- **Response:** "Negative, nothing visible"
- **Significance:** If mothership "size of two aircraft carriers," United should've seen it
- **Believer counter:** "Object cloaked/departed before United looked"

**The Autokinetic Effect:**
- **Psychology:** Stationary light appears to move when stared at in dark (eye movement illusion)
- **Explains:** "Lights approaching" perception (when actually stationary)
- **Common:** Pilots, sailors report (mistaking stars/planets for approaching craft)

**USAF Presence in Alaska:**
- **Elmendorf AFB:** Major base (fighter jets, tankers)
- **Refueling exercises:** Routine (KC-135 tankers + fighters)
- **Skeptic:** "Mothership = tanker silhouette"
- **Believer:** "Terauchi knows what tanker looks like"

**Radar Temperature Inversion:**
- **Atmospheric ducting:** Radar waves bend, create false targets
- **Common in Alaska:** Temperature gradients frequent
- **Skeptic:** "Explains radar 'target'"
- **Believer:** "Two separate radars detected—unlikely both fooled"

**Media Coverage:**
- **1986:** International headlines
- **Japan:** Major story (JAL = national airline)
- **U.S.:** Covered, but less prominent
- **Legacy:** One of most-cited pilot UFO cases

**FAA's Official Position (March 5, 1987 Press Conference):**
- **3-month investigation completed**
- **Conclusion:** "Uncorrelated primary and beacon target" (only control tower radar saw it, no other systems)
- **Statement:** "FAA **did not have enough material to confirm that something was there**" (but accepted crew descriptions)
- **Case closed:** "Unexplained" (not confirmed as UFO, not officially debunked as misidentification)
- **Terauchi classification:** **"UFO repeater"** (two prior sightings + two more Jan 1987)
- **Ambiguous:** Neither side can claim FAA endorsement
