## The Incident

16-year-old Ronald Johnson witnessed glowing object hovering near ground on his family's farm. After object departed, a glowing ring remained on the ground. The ring showed unusual properties: soil within ring was crystallized, water-repellent, and glowed. Effects persisted for weeks. Parents and investigators documented the ring.

## The Evidence

- Glowing luminescent ring on ground
- Soil chemistry altered (higher calcium, unusual crystalline structure)
- Water wouldn't penetrate ring soil
- Tree near site showed damage
- Multiple witnesses (Ronald, parents, investigators)

## My Take

Intriguing physical trace case. The soil alterations were real and documented. Most likely explanations: fungal ring (fairy ring) enhanced by chemicals, ball lightning effects, or hoax using chemicals. The persistence of effects and multiple witnesses make hoax less likely but not impossible. Case represents good physical evidence worthy of scientific study, though not definitively proving extraordinary cause.

Brief episode focusing on the physical evidence. Demonstrates pattern: physical traces are real, but "unusual" doesn't necessarily mean "impossible to explain."
