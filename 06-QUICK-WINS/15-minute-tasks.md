## 15-MINUTE SPRINT STRATEGY

**How to use 15-minute blocks:**

1. **Set a timer** for 15 minutes
2. **Pick ONE task** from above
3. **Work focused** until timer goes off
4. **Stop** even if you're not done
5. **Check it off** and celebrate

**Benefits:**
- Prevents overwhelm
- Creates clear start/end
- Builds momentum
- Prevents perfectionism paralysis

**If you have multiple 15-min blocks:**
- Do 2-3 different tasks
- Take 5-min breaks between
- Don't push past energy

**Pick ONE task. Set timer. Start.**

**15 MINUTES OF PROGRESS > 0 MINUTES.**
