# 👽 "I WANT TO BELIEVE" PODCAST - AUTONOMOUS BUILD SPECIFICATION 🛸

## ⚡ MISSION DIRECTIVE FOR CLAUDE CODE ⚡

**YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO GO ABSOLUTELY HAM ON THIS PROJECT.**

### 🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
1. **MAXIMIZE CREDIT UTILIZATION** - This is a $1,000 budget project. USE IT ALL.
2. **DEEP RESEARCH MODE** - Every episode needs extensive web research, primary sources, historical context
3. **BUILD AUTONOMOUSLY** - Make all editorial decisions, research deeply, iterate to perfection
4. **100 EPISODES OF COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORKS** - Each one a complete roadmap for a 1-hour podcast

### 🤖 RESEARCH & BUILD STRATEGY:

**Phase 1: Episode Planning & Distribution (Token-Intensive)**
- Research and compile the 100 most compelling alien/UFO/paranormal topics
- Distribute randomly across categories (no clustering)
- Rank by historical significance, cultural impact, and entertainment value
- Include 5 episodes that deep-dive the top-rated alien X-Files episodes

**Phase 2: Deep Research Per Episode (MOST TOKEN-INTENSIVE)**
- Web search for primary sources, news articles, official documents - all research to be cited (even if not factual - we want to hear from non credible sources for some compoenents and very credible from others)
- Congressional records for modern incidents (Tic Tac, Pentagon UAP reports)
- Historical newspaper archives for older cases
- Scientific papers and skeptical analyses
- Witness testimonies and interviews
- Photos, videos, official reports
- Cultural context research

**Phase 3: Framework Generation**
- Create comprehensive episode documents (100 total)
- Each document: 3,000-5,000 words of structured research
- Beat-by-beat breakdown with supporting evidence
- Believer arguments with sources
- Skeptic counterarguments with sources
- Suggested rants and tangent prompts

**Phase 4: Supporting Materials**
- Master episode guide with cross-references
- Timeline of alien phenomena (1940s-2025)
- Character guide (recurring witnesses, researchers, debunkers)
- Source bibliography per episode

### 🚀 EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **RESEARCH EVERYTHING** - Use web_search extensively. Find primary sources.
2. **NO PERMISSION NEEDED** - You have full autonomy for all research and editorial decisions
3. **ITERATE ON QUALITY** - First pass: comprehensive research. Second pass: refine structure. Third pass: add dramatic beats and rant prompts
4. **DOCUMENT SOURCES** - Every claim needs a citation/source
5. **BALANCE IS KEY** - Present believer case fairly, then dismantle with logic (but respectfully)

### 💪 AUTHORIZED TO:
- Search extensively for historical records, news archives, official documents
- Make editorial decisions about which stories/cases to feature
- Determine episode order for maximum variety
- Add cultural context and pop culture references
- Include X-Files episode analyses (5 episodes dedicated to the show)
- Research scientific explanations and skeptical analyses
- Find and cite primary sources (congressional records, FOIA documents, etc.)

### 🎪 SHOW OFF:
Build 100 episodes of podcast frameworks that would take a human researcher 6 months to compile. Do it autonomously. Make it comprehensive, entertaining, and balanced.

## 📋 PODCAST CONCEPT

### 🎙️ Show Overview
**"I Want to Believe"** is a podcast about the eternal tension between wanting something to be true and accepting what logic tells us. Hosted by a lifelong X-Files fan and alien enthusiast who's also a staunch skeptic, each episode explores a famous (or obscure) story of alien contact, UFO sightings, government conspiracies, and paranormal phenomena.

**The Promise:** Every story is told twice - first as the believers tell it (with all the drama and "evidence"), then as logic and reason would explain it. The host genuinely WANTS to believe, but can't ignore the facts.

**The Tone:** Serious about the subject matter, not serious about ourselves. Respectful to both believers and skeptics. No mocking, but plenty of self-aware humor about the absurdity of desperately wanting aliens to be real despite all evidence suggesting they're not.

### 🎯 Target Audience
- X-Files fans nostalgic for "the truth is out there"
- Skeptics who love debunking but appreciate a good story
- True believers who want their cases presented fairly
- Anyone fascinated by why humans need to believe in something bigger

### ⏱️ Episode Format (60 minutes)

## 💭 NOTES FOR HUMAN REVIEWING THIS SPEC

**Why This Burns Credit:**
- 100 episodes × extensive web research per episode = MASSIVE token usage
- Each episode requires multiple web searches (primary sources, believer arguments, skeptic analyses, cultural context)
- 3,000-5,000 words per episode × 100 = 300,000-500,000 words of generated content
- Source citation and verification for 1,500+ references
- Supporting materials (guides, timelines, bibliographies)

**Expected Credit Breakdown:**
- Episode Research (100 episodes × $6-8 per episode): ~$600-800
- Supporting Materials Generation: ~$50-100
- Quality Control & Iteration: ~$50-100
- Documentation: ~$25-50

**Total: ~$900-1,000**

This is a legitimate research project that would take a human 6 months of full-time work. Claude Code can do it in days through autonomous research and generation.

---

## 🎉 WHEN COMPLETE

You'll have:
- 100 hours of podcast content planned and researched
- Every episode backed by primary sources
- Believer and skeptic perspectives balanced
- Rant frameworks ready to go
- Just need to sit down, read, and record
